编选介绍

｛小｝｛说｝｛t｝｛xt｝｛天｝｛堂
《唐诗三百首》的编选者蘅塘退士(1711～1778)，原名孙洙，字临西，江苏无锡人。他自幼家贫，性敏好学，寒冬腊月读书时，常握一木，谓木能生火可敌寒。乾隆九年(1745)他考中顺天举人，授景山官学教习，出任上元县教谕。乾隆十六年(1752)他得中进士，历任卢龙、大城知县。后遭人谗陷罢官，平复后任山东邹平知县。乾隆二十五年(1761)、二十七年(1763)两次主持乡试，推掖名士。他为官清廉如水，爱民如子，又勤勉好学，书似欧阳询，诗宗杜工部，著有《蘅塘漫稿》。乾隆二十八年春，孙洙与他的继室夫人徐兰英相互商榷，开始编选《唐诗三百首》。编选这本书是有感于《千家诗》选诗标准不严，体裁不备，体例不一，希望以新的选本取而代之，成为合适的、流传不废的家塾课本。他们的选诗标准是“因专就唐诗中脍炙人口之作，择其尤要者”。既好又易诵，以体裁为经，以时间为纬。《唐诗三百首》于清乾隆二十九年(1765)编辑完成，书的题目有的说脱胎于民谚“熟读唐诗三百首，不会做诗也会吟”，有的说取自“诗三百”，说法各不相同。 ⊙内容提要 《唐诗三百首》共选入唐代诗人77位，计310首诗，其中五言古诗33首，乐府46首，七言古诗28首，七言律诗50首，五言绝句29首，七言绝句51首，诸诗配有注释和评点。 五言古诗简称五古，是唐代诗坛较为流行的体裁。唐人五古笔力豪纵，气象万千，直接用于叙事、抒情、议论、写景，使其功能得到了空前的发挥，其代表作家有李白、杜甫、王维、孟浩然、韦应物等。 七言古诗简称七古，起源于战国时期，甚至更早。现在公认最早的、最完整的七古是曹丕的《燕歌行》。南北朝时期，鲍照致力于七古创作，将之衍变成一种充满活力的诗体。唐代七古显示出大唐宏放的气象，手法多样，深沉开阔，代表诗人有李白、杜甫、韩愈。 五言律诗简称五律，是律诗的一种。五律源于五言古体，风格峻整，音律雄浑，含蓄深厚，成为唐人应制、应试以及日常生活中普遍采用的诗歌题材。唐代五律名家数不胜数，以王昌龄、王维、孟浩然、李白、杜甫、刘长卿成就为大。 七言律诗简称七律，是近体诗的一种，格律要求与五律相同。七律源于七言古体，在初唐时期渐成规模，至杜甫臻至炉火纯青。有唐一代，七律圣手有王维、杜甫、李商隐、杜牧、罗隐等，风华绝代，辉映古今。 五七言绝句简称五绝和七绝，都是古典诗体中绝句的一种。五绝起源于汉，七绝起源于六朝，两者都在齐梁时期成型，初唐阶段成熟。唐代绝句气象高远，率真自然，达到了吟诵自由化的最高峰，名家有李白、王维、王昌龄、韦应物、杜牧、刘禹锡等人。 ⊙作品影响 中国是诗的国度，唐朝是中国诗歌的巅峰，巅峰时期的那个黄金时代令人神往。诗歌是当时文学的最高代表，成为中国传统文学坚实的重要组成部分，也是中华文明靓丽的风景线。 唐诗与宋词、元曲并称，题材宽泛，众体兼备，格调高雅，是中国诗歌发展史上的奇迹。唐诗对中国文学的影响极为深远。历朝历代的文人视唐诗为圭臬，奉唐人为典范。公元7世纪，孙季良开始编纂唐诗选本，至辛亥革命前，一千二百余年间，每二年即有一本唐诗选本问世。众多选本中以《唐诗三百首》流传最广、影响最大，风行海内，老幼皆宜，雅俗共赏，成为屡印不止的最经典的选本之一。《唐诗三百首》以成功务实的编法、简易适中的篇幅、通俗大众的观点、入选的精美诗歌打动着读者，成为儿童最成功的启蒙教材、了解中国文化的模范读本，对中国诗歌选编学、中国人的心理构成都有很大的影响。 ⊙精彩篇章 慈母手中线，游子身上衣。临行密密缝，意恐迟迟归。谁言寸草心，报得三春晖。——孟郊《游子吟》 红豆生南国，春来发几枝。愿君多采撷，此物最相思。——王维《相思》 春眠不觉晓，处处闻啼鸟。夜来风雨声，花落知多少。——孟浩然《春晓》 白日依山尽，黄河入海流。欲穷千里目，更上一层楼。——王之涣《登鹳雀楼》 ⊙延伸阅读 《千家诗》由南宋著名词人刘克庄编辑的蓝本增删而成，从宋代至今，在民间流传很广，是非常有名的儿童启蒙读物。所选诗为唐宋两代的作品，大多文采晓畅，易于吟诵。 《全唐诗》在康熙四十五(1707)年，由彭定求、沈三曾等编校而成，收诗4.8万多首，作者2000余人，是自唐到清内容最丰富的唐诗总集。此后，由于敦煌文书的出土以及新的唐诗的发现，《全唐诗》得以更加完善，又增加了数千首唐诗。 《唐诗别裁集》于康熙五十六年(1718)问世，由江苏苏州人沈德潜编辑而成，这部书重点突出了沈德潜的文学思想，在清代的文士间影响较大。 全本共有三百又二十首诗，原由蘅塘退士选辑，分为六卷。

张九龄 
感遇其一
孤鸿海上来， 池潢不敢顾； 
侧见双翠鸟， 巢在三珠树。 
矫矫珍木巅， 得无金丸惧？ 
美服患人指， 高明逼神恶。 
今我游冥冥， 弋者何所慕？ 
five-character-ancient-verse
zhang jiuling
thoughts i
a lonely swan from the sea flies, 
to alight on puddles it does not deign. 
nesting in the poplar of pearls 
it spies and questions green birds twain: 
"dont you fear the threat of slings, 
perched on top of branches so high? 
nice clothes invite pointing fingers, 
high climbers gods good will defy. 
bird-hunters will crave me in vain, 
for i roam the limitless sky." 
002
五言古诗
张九龄
感遇其二
兰叶春葳蕤， 桂华秋皎洁； 
欣欣此生意， 自尔为佳节。 
谁知林栖者？ 闻风坐相悦， 
草木有本心， 何求美人折？ 
five-character-ancient-verse
zhang jiuling
orchid and orange i
tender orchid-leaves in spring 
and cinnamon- blossoms bright in autumn 
are as self- contained as life is, 
which conforms them to the seasons. 
yet why will you think that a forest-hermit, 
allured by sweet winds and contented with beauty, 
would no more ask to-be transplanted 
than would any other natural flower? 
003
五言古诗
张九龄 
感遇其三
幽人归独卧， 滞虑洗孤清， 
持此谢高鸟， 因之传远情。 
日夕怀空意， 人谁感至精？ 
飞沈理自隔， 何所慰吾诚？ 
five-character-ancient-verse
zhang jiuling
thoughts iii
the hermit in his lone abode 
nurses his thoughts cleansed of care, 
them he projects to the wild goose 
for it to his distant sovereign to bear. 
who will be moved by the sincerity 
of my vain day-and-night prayer? 
what comfort is for my loyalty 
when fliers and sinkers can compare? 
004
五言古诗
张九龄
感遇其四
江南有丹橘， 经冬犹绿林； 
岂伊地气暖？ 自有岁寒心。 
可以荐嘉客， 奈何阻重深？ 
运命惟所遇， 循环不可寻。 
徒言树桃李， 此木岂无阴？ 
five-character-ancient-verse
zhang jiuling
orchid and orange ii
here, south of the yangzi, grows a red orangetree. 
all winter long its leaves are green, 
not because of a warmer soil, 
but because its nature is used to the cold. 
though it might serve your honourable guests, 
you leave it here, far below mountain and river. 
circumstance governs destiny. 
cause and effect are an infinite cycle. 
you plant your peach-trees and your plums, 
you forget the shade from this other tree. 
005
五言古诗
李白
下终南山过斛斯山人宿置酒
暮从碧山下， 山月随人归； 
却顾所来径， 苍苍横翠微。 
相携及田家， 童稚开荆扉； 
绿竹入幽径， 青萝拂行衣。 
欢言得所憩， 美酒聊共挥； 
长歌吟松风， 曲尽河星稀。 
我醉君复乐， 陶然共忘机。 
five-character-ancient-verse
li bai
down zhongnan mountain 
to the kind pillow and bowl of husi
down the blue mountain in the evening, 
moonlight was my homeward escort. 
looking back, i saw my path 
lie in levels of deep shadow.... 
i was passing the farm-house of a friend, 
when his children called from a gate of thorn 
and led me twining through jade bamboos 
where green vines caught and held my clothes. 
and i was glad of a chance to rest 
and glad of a chance to drink with my friend.... 
we sang to the tune of the wind in the pines; 
and we finished our songs as the stars went down, 
when, i being drunk and my friend more than happy, 
between us we forgot the world. 
006
五言古诗
李白
月下独酌
花间一壶酒， 独酌无相亲； 
举杯邀明月， 对影成三人。 
月既不解饮， 影徒随我身； 
暂伴月将影， 行乐须及春。 
我歌月徘徊， 我舞影零乱； 
醒时同交欢， 醉后各分散。 
永结无情游， 相期邈云汉。 
five-character-ancient-verse
li bai
drinking alone with the moon
from a pot of wine among the flowers 
i drank alone. there was no one with me -- 
till, raising my cup, i asked the bright moon 
to bring me my shadow and make us three. 
alas, the moon was unable to drink 
and my shadow tagged me vacantly; 
but still for a while i had these friends 
to cheer me through the end of spring.... 
i sang. the moon encouraged me. 
i danced. my shadow tumbled after. 
as long as i knew, we were boon companions. 
and then i was drunk, and we lost one another. 
...shall goodwill ever be secure? 
i watch the long road of the river of stars. 
007
五言古诗
李白
春思
燕草如碧丝， 秦桑低绿枝； 
当君怀归日， 是妾断肠时。 
春风不相识， 何事入罗帏？ 
five-character-ancient-verse
li bai
in spring
your grasses up north are as blue as jade, 
our mulberries here curve green-threaded branches; 
and at last you think of returning home, 
now when my heart is almost broken.... 
o breeze of the spring, since i dare not know you, 
why part the silk curtains by my bed? 
008
五言古诗
杜甫
望岳
岱宗夫如何？ 齐鲁青未了。 
造化钟神秀， 阴阳割昏晓。 
荡胸生层云， 决眥入归鸟。 
会当凌绝顶， 一览众山小。 
又作岳
five-character-ancient-verse
du fu
a view of taishan
what shall i say of the great peak? -- 
the ancient dukedoms are everywhere green, 
inspired and stirred by the breath of creation, 
with the twin forces balancing day and night. 
...i bare my breast toward opening clouds, 
i strain my sight after birds flying home. 
when shall i reach the top and hold 
all mountains in a single glance? 
009
五言古诗
杜甫
赠卫八处士
人生不相见， 动如参与商， 
今夕复何夕？ 共此灯烛光。 
少壮能几时？ 鬓发各已苍。 
访旧半为鬼， 惊呼热中肠。 
焉知二十载， 重上君子堂。 
昔别君未婚， 儿女忽成行； 
怡然敬父执， 问我来何方。 
问答乃未已， 驱儿罗酒浆。 
夜雨剪春韭， 新炊间黄粱。 
主称会面难， 一举累十觞； 
十觞亦不醉， 感子故意长。 
明日隔山岳， 世事两茫茫。

du fu
to my retired friend wei
it is almost as hard for friends to meet 
as for the morning and evening stars. 
tonight then is a rare event, 
joining, in the candlelight, 
two men who were young not long ago 
but now are turning grey at the temples. 
...to find that half our friends are dead 
shocks us, burns our hearts with grief. 
we little guessed it would be twenty years 
before i could visit you again. 
when i went away, you were still unmarried; 
but now these boys and girls in a row 
are very kind to their fathers old friend. 
they ask me where i have been on my journey; 
and then, when we have talked awhile, 
they bring and show me wines and dishes, 
spring chives cut in the night-rain 
and brown rice cooked freshly a special way. 
...my host proclaims it a festival, 
he urges me to drink ten cups -- 
but what ten cups could make me as drunk 
as i always am with your love in my heart? 
...tomorrow the mountains will separate us; 
after tomorrow-who can say?

五言古诗
杜甫
佳人
绝代有佳人， 幽居在空谷； 
自云良家子， 零落依草木。 
关中昔丧乱， 兄弟遭杀戮； 
官高何足论？ 不得收骨肉。 
世情恶衰歇， 万事随转烛。 
夫婿轻薄儿， 新人美如玉。 
合昏尚知时， 鸳鸯不独宿； 
但见新人笑， 那闻旧人哭？ 
在山泉水清， 出山泉水浊。 
侍婢卖珠回， 牵萝补茅屋。 
摘花不插发， 采柏动盈掬。 
天寒翠袖薄， 日暮倚修竹。 
five-character-ancient-verse
du fu
alone in her beauty
who is lovelier than she? 
yet she lives alone in an empty valley. 
she tells me she came from a good family 
which is humbled now into the dust. 
...when trouble arose in the kuan district, 
her brothers and close kin were killed. 
what use were their high offices, 
not even shielding their own lives? -- 
the world has but scorn for adversity; 
hope goes out, like the light of a candle. 
her husband, with a vagrant heart, 
seeks a new face like a new piece of jade; 
and when morning-glories furl at night 
and mandarin-ducks lie side by side, 
all he can see is the smile of the new love, 
while the old love weeps unheard. 
the brook was pure in its mountain source, 
but away from the mountain its waters darken. 
...waiting for her maid to come from selling pearls 
for straw to cover the roof again, 
she picks a few flowers, no longer for her hair, 
and lets pine-needles fall through her fingers, 
and, forgetting her thin silk sleeve and the cold, 
she leans in the sunset by a tall bamboo.

梦李白之一
死别已吞声， 生别常恻恻。 
江南瘴疠地， 逐客无消息。 
故人入我梦， 明我长相忆； 
君今在罗网， 何以有羽翼？ 
恐非平生魂， 路远不可测。 
魂来枫林青， 魂返关塞黑； 
落月满屋梁， 犹疑照颜色。 
水深波浪阔， 无使蛟龙得。

seeing li bai in a dream i
there are sobs when death is the cause of parting; 
but life has its partings again and again. 
...from the poisonous damps of the southern river 
you had sent me not one sign from your exile -- 
till you came to me last night in a dream, 
because i am always thinking of you. 
i wondered if it were really you, 
venturing so long a journey. 
you came to me through the green of a forest, 
you disappeared by a shadowy fortress.... 
yet out of the midmost mesh of your snare, 
how could you lift your wings and use them? 
...i woke, and the low moons glimmer on a rafter 
seemed to be your face, still floating in the air. 
...there were waters to cross, they were wild and tossing; 
if you fell, there were dragons and rivermonsters.

千秋万岁名， 寂寞身后事。

seeing li bai in a dream ii
this cloud, that has drifted all day through the sky, 
may, like a wanderer, never come back.... 
three nights now i have dreamed of you -- 
as tender, intimate and real as though i were awake. 
and then, abruptly rising to go, 
you told me the perils of adventure 
by river and lake-the storms, the wrecks, 
the fears that are borne on a little boat; 
and, here in my doorway, you rubbed your white head 
as if there were something puzzling you. 
...our capital teems with officious people, 
while you are alone and helpless and poor. 
who says that the heavenly net never fails? 
it has brought you ill fortune, old as you are. 
...a thousand years fame, ten thousand years fame- 
what good, when you are dead and gone.

to qiwu qian bound home
after failing in an examination
in a happy reign there should be no hermits; 
the wise and able should consult together.... 
so you, a man of the eastern mountains, 
gave up your life of picking herbs 
and came all the way to the gate of gold -- 
but you found your devotion unavailing. 
...to spend the day of no fire on one of the southern rivers, 
you have mended your spring clothes here in these northern cities. 
i pour you the farewell wine as you set out from the capital -- 
soon i shall be left behind here by my bosomfriend. 
in your sail-boat of sweet cinnamon-wood 
you will float again toward your own thatch door, 
led along by distant trees 
to a sunset shining on a far-away town. 
...what though your purpose happened to fail, 
doubt not that some of us can hear high music.

a green stream
i have sailed the river of yellow flowers, 
borne by the channel of a green stream, 
rounding ten thousand turns through the mountains 
on a journey of less than thirty miles.... 
rapids hum over heaped rocks; 
but where light grows dim in the thick pines, 
the surface of an inlet sways with nut-horns 
and weeds are lush along the banks. 
...down in my heart i have always been as pure 
as this limpid water is.... 
oh, to remain on a broad flat rock 
and to cast a fishing-line forever!

there are whirring pheasants? full wheat-ears, 
silk-worms asleep, pared mulberry-leaves.

hail one another familiarly. 
...no wonder i long for the simple life 
and am sighing the old song, oh, to go back again!

the beautiful xi shi
since beauty is honoured all over the empire, 
how could xi shi remain humbly at home? -- 
washing clothes at dawn by a southern lake -- 
and that evening a great lady in a palace of the north: 
lowly one day, no different from the others, 
the next day exalted, everyone praising her. 
no more would her own hands powder her face 
or arrange on her shoulders a silken robe. 
and the more the king loved her, the lovelier she looked, 
blinding him away from wisdom. 
...girls who had once washed silk beside her 
were kept at a distance from her chariot. 
and none of the girls in her neighbours houses 
by pursing their brows could copy her beauty.

on climbing orchid mountain 
in the autumn to zhang
on a northern peak among white clouds 
you have found your hermitage of peace; 
and now, as i climb this mountain to see you, 
high with the wildgeese flies my heart. 
the quiet dusk might seem a little sad 
if this autumn weather were not so brisk and clear; 
i look down at the river bank, with homeward-bound villagers 
resting on the sand till the ferry returns; 
there are trees at the horizon like a row of grasses 
and against the rivers rim an island like the moon 
i hope that you will come and meet me, bringing a basket of wine -- 
and well celebrate together the mountain holiday.

i loosen my hair to enjoy the evening coolness

the wind brings me odours of lotuses,

but, alas, who here would understand? 
and so i think of you, old friend, 
o troubler of my midnight dreams !

playing lute under a wayside vine.

it will move through the cycle, full moon and then crescent again, 
calmly, beyond our wisdom, altering new to old. 
...our chosen one, our friend, is now by a limpid river -- 
singing, perhaps, a plaintive eastern song. 
he is far, far away from us, three hundred miles away. 
and yet a breath of orchids comes along the wind.

i have peeped into your room, at your seat beside the table. 
perhaps you are out riding in your canopied chair, 
or fishing, more likely, in some autumn pool. 
sorry though i am to be missing you, 
you have become my meditation -- 
the beauty of your grasses, fresh with rain, 
and close beside your window the music of your pines. 
i take into my being all that i see and hear, 
soothing my senses, quieting my heart; 
and though there be neither host nor guest, 
have i not reasoned a visit complete? 
...after enough, i have gone down the mountain. 
why should i wait for you any longer?

and only to be an old man with a fishing-pole.

ascending the pagoda at the temple of kind 
favour with gao shi and xue ju
the pagoda, rising abruptly from earth, 
reaches to the very palace of heaven.... 
climbing, we seem to have left the world behind us, 
with the steps we look down on hung from space. 
it overtops a holy land 
and can only have been built by toil of the spirit. 
its four sides darken the bright sun, 
its seven stories cut the grey clouds; 
birds fly down beyond our sight, 
and the rapid wind below our hearing; 
mountain-ranges, toward the east, 
appear to be curving and flowing like rivers; 
far green locust-trees line broad roads 
toward clustered palaces and mansions; 
colours of autumn, out of the west, 
enter advancing through the city; 
and northward there lie, in five graveyards, 
calm forever under dewy green grass, 
those who know lifes final meaning 
which all humankind must learn. 
...henceforth i put my official hat aside. 
to find the eternal way is the only happiness.

to the tax-collectors 
after the bandits retreat
in the year kuimao the bandits from xiyuan entered daozhou, set fire, raided, killed, and looted. the whole district was almost ruined. the next year the bandits came again and, attacking the neighbouring prefecture, yong, passed this one by. it was not because we were strong enough to defend ourselves, but, probably, because they pitied us. and how now can these commissioners bear to impose extra taxes? i have written this poem for the collectors information. 
i still remember those days of peace -- 
twenty years among mountains and forests, 
the pure stream running past my yard, 
the caves and valleys at my door. 
taxes were light and regular then, 
and i could sleep soundly and late in the morning- 
till suddenly came a sorry change. 
...for years now i have been serving in the army. 
when i began here as an official, 
the mountain bandits were rising again; 
but the town was so small it was spared by the thieves, 
and the people so poor and so pitiable 
that all other districts were looted 
and this one this time let alone. 
...do you imperial commissioners 
mean to be less kind than bandits? 
the people you force to pay the poll 
are like creatures frying over a fire. 
and how can you sacrifice human lives, 
just to be known as able collectors? -- 
...oh, let me fling down my official seal, 
let me be a lone fisherman in a small boat 
and support my family on fish and wheat 
and content my old age with rivers and lakes!

幼为长所育， 两别泣不休。 
对此结中肠， 义往难复留。 
自小阙内训， 事姑贻我忧； 
赖兹托令门， 仁恤庶无尤。 
贫俭诚所尚， 资从岂待周！ 
孝恭遵妇道， 容止顺其猷。 
别离在今晨， 见尔当何秋？ 
居闲始自遣， 临感忽难收。 
归来视幼女， 零泪缘缨流。

wei yingwu
to my daughter 
on her marriage into the yang family
my heart has been heavy all day long 
because you have so far to go. 
the marriage of a girl, away from her parents, 
is the launching of a little boat on a great river. 
...you were very young when your mother died, 
which made me the more tender of you. 
your elder sister has looked out for you, 
and now you are both crying and cannot part. 
this makes my grief the harder to bear; 
yet it is right that you should go. 
...having had from childhood no mother to guide you, 
how will you honour your mother-in-law? 
its an excellent family; they will be kind to you, 
they will forgive you your mistakes -- 
although ours has been so pure and poor 
that you can take them no great dowry. 
be gentle and respectful, as a woman should be, 
careful of word and look, observant of good example. 
...after this morning we separate, 
theres no knowing for how long.... 
i always try to hide my feelings -- 
they are suddenly too much for me, 
when i turn and see my younger daughter 
with the tears running down her cheek.

liu zongyuan
reading buddhist classics with zhao 
at his temple in the early morning
i clean my teeth in water drawn from a cold well; 
and while i brush my clothes, i purify my mind; 
then, slowly turning pages in the tree-leaf book, 
i recite, along the path to the eastern shelter. 
...the world has forgotten the true fountain of this teaching 
and people enslave themselves to miracles and fables. 
under the given words i want the essential meaning, 
i look for the simplest way to sow and reap my nature. 
here in the quiet of the priests templecourtyard, 
mosses add their climbing colour to the thick bamboo; 
and now comes the sun, out of mist and fog, 
and pines that seem to be new-bathed; 
and everything is gone from me, speech goes, and reading, 
leaving the single unison.

i had so long been troubled by official hat and robe

i am a neighbour now of planters and reapers. 
i am a guest of the mountains and woods. 
i plough in the morning, turning dewy grasses, 
and at evening tie my fisher-boat, breaking the quiet stream. 
back and forth i go, scarcely meeting anyone, 
and sing a long poem and gaze at the blue sky.

a song of changgan
my hair had hardly covered my forehead. 
i was picking flowers, paying by my door, 
when you, my lover, on a bamboo horse, 
came trotting in circles and throwing green plums. 
we lived near together on a lane in chang-kan, 
both of us young and happy-hearted. 
...at fourteen i became your wife, 
so bashful that i dared not smile, 
and i lowered my head toward a dark corner 
and would not turn to your thousand calls; 
but at fifteen i straightened my brows and laughed, 
learning that no dust could ever seal our love, 
that even unto death i would await you by my post 
and would never lose heart in the tower of silent watching. 
...then when i was sixteen, you left on a long journey 
through the gorges of chu-tang, of rock and whirling water. 
and then came the fifth-month, more than i could bear, 
and i tried to hear the monkeys in your lofty far-off sky. 
your footprints by our door, where i had watched you go, 
were hidden, every one of them, under green moss, 
hidden under moss too deep to sweep away. 
and the first autumn wind added fallen leaves. 
and now, in the eighth-month, yellowing butterflies 
hover, two by two, in our west-garden grasses 
and, because of all this, my heart is breaking 
and i fear for my bright cheeks, lest they fade. 
...oh, at last, when you return through the three pa districts, 
send me a message home ahead! 
and i will come and meet you and will never mind the distance, 
all the way to chang-feng sha.

and, recklessly risking his seven-foot body, 
would slay whoever dared confront 
those moustaches that bristled like porcupinequills. 
...there were dark clouds below the hills, there were white clouds above them, 
but before a man has served full time, how can he go back? 
in eastern liao a girl was waiting, a girl of fifteen years, 
deft with a guitar, expert in dance and song. 
...she seems to be fluting, even now, a reed-song of home, 
filling every soldiers eyes with homesick tears.

while our horses whinny on the road, eager to turn homeward. 
...chen, my friend, you have always been a great and good man, 
with your dragons moustache, tigers eyebrows and your massive forehead. 
in your bosom you have shelved away ten thousand volumes. 
you have held your head high, never bowed it in the dust. 
...after buying us wine and pledging us, here at the eastern gate, 
and taking things as lightly as a wildgoose feather, 
flat you lie, tipsy, forgetting the white sun; 
but now and then you open your eyes and gaze at a high lone cloud. 
...the tide-head of the lone river joins the darkening sky. 
the ferryman beaches his boat. it has grown too late to sail. 
and people on their way from cheng cannot go home, 
and people from loyang sigh with disappointment. 
...i have heard about the many friends around your wood land dwelling. 
yesterday you were dismissed. are they your friends today?

on hearing dong play the flageolet 
a poem to palace-attendant fang
when this melody for the flageolet was made by lady cai, 
when long ago one by one she sang its eighteen stanzas, 
even the tartars were shedding tears into the border grasses, 
and the envoy of china was heart-broken, turning back home with his escort. 
...cold fires now of old battles are grey on ancient forts, 
and the wilderness is shadowed with white new-flying snow. 
...when the player first brushes the shang string and the jue and then the yu, 
autumn-leaves in all four quarters are shaken with a murmur. 
dong, the master, 
must have been taught in heaven. 
demons come from the deep pine-wood and stealthily listen 
to music slow, then quick, following his hand, 
now far away, now near again, according to his heart. 
a hundred birds from an empty mountain scatter and return; 
three thousand miles of floating clouds darken and lighten; 
a wildgoose fledgling, left behind, cries for its flock, 
and a tartar child for the mother he loves. 
then river waves are calmed 
and birds are mute that were singing, 
and wuzu tribes are homesick for their distant land, 
and out of the dust of siberian steppes rises a plaintive sorrow. 
...suddenly the low sound leaps to a freer tune, 
like a long wind swaying a forest, a downpour breaking tiles, 
a cascade through the air, flying over tree-tops. 
...a wild deer calls to his fellows. he is running among the mansions 
in the corner of the capital by the eastern palace wall.... 
phoenix lake lies opposite the gate of green jade; 
but how can fame and profit concern a man of genius? 
day and night i long for him to bring his lute again.

on hearing an wanshan play the reed-pipe
bamboo from the southern hills was used to make this pipe. 
and its music, that was introduced from persia first of all, 
has taken on new magic through later use in china. 
and now the tartar from liangzhou, blowing it for me, 
drawing a sigh from whosoever hears it, 
is bringing to a wanderers eyes homesick tears.... 
many like to listen; but few understand. 
to and fro at will theres a long wind flying, 
dry mulberry-trees, old cypresses, trembling in its chill. 
there are nine baby phoenixes, outcrying one another; 
a dragon and a tiger spring up at the same moment; 
then in a hundred waterfalls ten thousand songs of autumn 
are suddenly changing to the yuyang lament; 
and when yellow clouds grow thin and the white sun darkens, 
they are changing still again to spring in the willow trees. 
like imperial garden flowers, brightening the eye with beauty, 
are the high-hall candles we have lighted this cold night, 
and with every cup of wine goes another round of music.

all five holy mountains, without a thought of distance,

lu mountain stands beside the southern dipper 
in clouds reaching silken like a nine-panelled screen, 
with its shadows in a crystal lake deepening the green water. 
the golden gate opens into two mountain-ranges. 
a silver stream is hanging down to three stone bridges 
within sight of the mighty tripod falls. 
ledges of cliff and winding trails lead to blue sky 
and a flush of cloud in the morning sun, 
whence no flight of birds could be blown into wu. 
...i climb to the top. i survey the whole world. 
i see the long river that runs beyond return, 
yellow clouds that winds have driven hundreds of miles 
and a snow-peak whitely circled by the swirl of a ninefold stream. 
and so i am singing a song of lu mountain, 
a song that is born of the breath of lu mountain. 
...where the stone mirror makes the hearts purity purer 
and green moss has buried the footsteps of xie, 
i have eaten the immortal pellet and, rid of the worlds troubles, 
before the lutes third playing have achieved my element. 
far away i watch the angels riding coloured clouds 
toward heavens jade city, with hibiscus in their hands. 
and so, when i have traversed the nine sections of the world, 
i will follow saint luao up the great purity.

tianmu mountain ascended in a dream
a seafaring visitor will talk about japan, 
which waters and mists conceal beyond approach; 
but yueh people talk about heavenly mother mountain, 
still seen through its varying deeps of cloud. 
in a straight line to heaven, its summit enters heaven, 
tops the five holy peaks, and casts a shadow through china 
with the hundred-mile length of the heavenly terrace range, 
which, just at this point, begins turning southeast. 
...my heart and my dreams are in wu and yueh 
and they cross mirror lake all night in the moon. 
and the moon lights my shadow 
and me to yan river -- 
with the hermitage of xie still there 
and the monkeys calling clearly over ripples of green water. 
i wear his pegged boots 
up a ladder of blue cloud, 
sunny ocean half-way, 
holy cock-crow in space, 
myriad peaks and more valleys and nowhere a road. 
flowers lure me, rocks ease me. day suddenly ends. 
bears, dragons, tempestuous on mountain and river, 
startle the forest and make the heights tremble. 
clouds darken with darkness of rain, 
streams pale with pallor of mist. 
the gods of thunder and lightning 
shatter the whole range. 
the stone gate breaks asunder 
venting in the pit of heaven, 
an impenetrable shadow. 
...but now the sun and moon illumine a gold and silver terrace, 
and, clad in rainbow garments, riding on the wind, 
come the queens of all the clouds, descending one by one, 
with tigers for their lute-players and phoenixes for dancers. 
row upon row, like fields of hemp, range the fairy figures. 
i move, my soul goes flying, 
i wake with a long sigh, 
my pillow and my matting 
are the lost clouds i was in. 
...and this is the way it always is with human joy:

a farewell to secretary shuyun 
at the xietiao villa in xuanzhou
since yesterday had to throw me and bolt, 
today has hurt my heart even more. 
the autumn wildgeese have a long wind for escort 
as i face them from this villa, drinking my wine. 
the bones of great writers are your brushes, in the school of heaven, 
and i am a lesser xie growing up by your side. 
we both are exalted to distant thought, 
aspiring to the sky and the bright moon. 
but since water still flows, though we cut it with our swords, 
and sorrows return, though we drown them with wine, 
since the world can in no way answer our craving, 
i will loosen my hair tomorrow and take to a fishingboat.

keep your iron armour on all night long, 
send your soldiers forward with a clattering of weapons! 
...while the sharp winds point cuts the face like a knife, 
and snowy sweat steams on the horses backs, 
freezing a pattern of five-flower coins, 
your challenge from camp, from an inkstand of ice, 
has chilled the barbarian chieftains heart.

blowing open the petals of ten thousand peartrees.

bows become rigid, can hardly be drawn 
and the metal of armour congeals on the men; 
the sand-sea deepens with fathomless ice, 
and darkness masses its endless clouds; 
but we drink to our guest bound home from camp, 
and play him barbarian lutes, guitars, harps; 
till at dusk, when the drifts are crushing our tents 
and our frozen red flags cannot flutter in the wind, 
we watch him through wheel-tower gate going eastward.

a drawing of a horse by general cao 
at secretary wei fengs house
throughout this dynasty no one had painted horses 
like the master-spirit, prince jiangdu -- 
and then to general cao through his thirty years of fame 
the worlds gaze turned, for royal steeds. 
he painted the late emperors luminous white horse. 
for ten days the thunder flew over dragon lake, 
and a pink-agate plate was sent him from the palace- 
the talk of the court-ladies, the marvel of all eyes. 
the general danced, receiving it in his honoured home 
after this rare gift, followed rapidly fine silks 
from many of the nobles, requesting that his art 
lend a new lustre to their screens. 
...first came the curly-maned horse of emperor taizong, 
then, for the guos, a lion-spotted horse.... 
but now in this painting i see two horses, 
a sobering sight for whosoever knew them. 
they are war- horses. either could face ten thousand. 
they make the white silk stretch away into a vast desert. 
and the seven others with them are almost as noble 
mist and snow are moving across a cold sky, 
and hoofs are cleaving snow-drifts under great trees- 
with here a group of officers and there a group of servants. 
see how these nine horses all vie with one another- 
the high clear glance, the deep firm breath. 
...who understands distinction? who really cares for art? 
you, wei feng, have followed cao; zhidun preceded him. 
...i remember when the late emperor came toward his summer palace, 
the procession, in green-feathered rows, swept from the eastern sky -- 
thirty thousand horses, prancing, galloping, 
fashioned, every one of them, like the horses in this picture.... 
but now the imperial ghost receives secret jade from the river god, 
for the emperor hunts crocodiles no longer by the streams. 
where you see his great gold tomb, you may hear among the pines 
a bird grieving in the wind that the emperors horses are gone.

先帝天马玉花骢， 画工如山貌不同。 
是日牵来赤墀下， 迥立阊阖生长风。 
诏谓将军拂绢素， 意匠惨淡经营中； 
斯须九重真龙出， 一洗万古凡马空。 
玉花却在御榻上， 榻上庭前屹相向； 
至尊含笑催赐金， 圉人太仆皆惆怅， 
弟子韩干早入室， 亦能画马穷殊相； 
干惟画肉不画骨， 忍使骅骝气凋丧。 
将军画善盖有神， 偶逢佳士亦写真；

a song of a painting to general cao
o general, descended from weis emperor wu, 
you are nobler now than when a noble.... 
conquerors and their velour perish, 
but masters of beauty live forever. 
...with your brush-work learned from lady wei 
and second only to wang xizhis, 
faithful to your art, you know no age, 
letting wealth and fame drift by like clouds. 
...in the years of kaiyuan you were much with the emperor, 
accompanied him often to the court of the south wind. 
when the spirit left great statesmen, on walls of the hall of fame 
the point of your brush preserved their living faces. 
you crowned all the premiers with coronets of office; 
you fitted all commanders with arrows at their girdles; 
you made the founders of this dynasty, with every hair alive, 
seem to be just back from the fierceness of a battle. 
...the late emperor had a horse, known as jade flower, 
whom artists had copied in various poses. 
they led him one day to the red marble stairs 
with his eyes toward the palace in the deepening air. 
then, general, commanded to proceed with your work, 
you centred all your being on a piece of silk. 
and later, when your dragon-horse, born of the sky, 
had banished earthly horses for ten thousand generations, 
there was one jade flower standing on the dais 
and another by the steps, and they marvelled at each other.... 
the emperor rewarded you with smiles and with gifts, 
while officers and men of the stud hung about and stared. 
...han gan, your follower, has likewise grown proficient 
at representing horses in all their attitudes; 
but picturing the flesh, he fails to draw the bone- 
so that even the finest are deprived of their spirit. 
you, beyond the mere skill, used your art divinely- 
and expressed, not only horses, but the life of a good man.... 
yet here you are, wandering in a world of disorder 
and sketching from time to time some petty passerby 
people note your case with the whites of their eyes. 
theres nobody purer, theres nobody poorer. 
...read in the records, from earliest times, 
how hard it is to be a great artist.

wildgeese flying high, sun and moon both white,

angels bound for the capital of heaven, near the north star, 
riding, some of them phrenixes, and others unicorns, 
with banners of hibiscus and with melodies of mist, 
their shadows dancing upside-down in the southern rivers, 
till the queen of the stars, drowsy with her nectar, 
would forget the winged men on either side of her! 
...from the wizard of the red pine this word has come for me: 
that after his earlier follower he has now a new disciple 
who, formerly at the capital as emperor lius adviser, 
in spite of great successes, never could be happy. 
...what are a countrys rise and fall? 
can flesh-pots be as fragrant as mountain fruit?.... 
i grieve that he is lost far away in the south. 
may the star of long life accord him its blessing!

and to place you as an offering in the court of imperial jade.

beside the temple of the great premier stands an ancient cypress

dating from the days of a great rulers great statesman, 
their very tree is loved now and honoured by the people. 
clouds come to it from far away, from the wu cliffs, 
and the cold moon glistens on its peak of snow. 
...east of the silk pavilion yesterday i found 
the ancient ruler and wise statesman both worshipped in one temple, 
whose tree, with curious branches, ages the whole landscape 
in spite of the fresh colours of the windows and the doors. 
and so firm is the deep root, so established underground, 
that its lone lofty boughs can dare the weight of winds, 
its only protection the heavenly power, 
its only endurance the art of its creator. 
though oxen sway ten thousand heads, they cannot move a mountain. 
...when beams are required to restore a great house, 
though a tree writes no memorial, yet people understand 
that not unless they fell it can use be made of it.... 
its bitter heart may be tenanted now by black and white ants, 
but its odorous leaves were once the nest of phoenixes and pheasants. 
...let wise and hopeful men harbour no complaint.

a song of dagger-dancing to a girl-pupil 
of lady gongsun
on the 19th of the tenth-month in the second year of dali, i saw, in the house of the kueifu official yuante, a girl named li from lingying dancing with a dagger. i admired her skill and asked who was her teacher. she named lady gongsun. i remembered that in the third year of kaiyuan at yancheng, when i was a little boy, i saw lady gongsun dance. she was the only one in the imperial theatre who could dance with this weapon. now she is aged and unknown, and even her pupil has passed the heyday of beauty. i wrote this poem to express my wistfulness. the work of zhang xu of the wu district, that great master of grassy writing, was improved by his having been present when lady gongsun danced in the yeh district. from this may be judged the art of gongsun. 
there lived years ago the beautiful gongsun, 
who, dancing with her dagger, drew from all four quarters 
an audience like mountains lost among themselves. 
heaven and earth moved back and forth, following her motions, 
which were bright as when the archer shot the nine suns down the sky 
and rapid as angels before the wings of dragons. 
she began like a thunderbolt, venting its anger, 
and ended like the shining calm of rivers and the sea.... 
but vanished are those red lips and those pearly sleeves; 
and none but this one pupil bears the perfume of her fame, 
this beauty from lingying, at the town of the white god, 
dancing still and singing in the old blithe way. 
and while we reply to each others questions, 
we sigh together, saddened by changes that have come. 
there were eight thousand ladies in the late emperors court, 
but none could dance the dagger-dance like lady gongsun. 
...fifty years have passed, like the turning of a palm; 
wind and dust, filling the world, obscure the imperial house. 
instead of the pear-garden players, who have blown by like a mist, 
there are one or two girl-musicians now-trying to charm the cold sun. 
there are man-size trees by the emperors golden tomb 
i seem to hear dead grasses rattling on the cliffs of qutang. 
...the song is done, the slow string and quick pipe have ceased. 
at the height of joy, sorrow comes with the eastern moon rising. 
and i, a poor old man, not knowing where to go, 
must harden my feet on the lone hills, toward sickness and despair.

rough were the mountain-stones, and the path very narrow; 
and when i reached the temple, bats were in the dusk. 
i climbed to the hall, sat on the steps, and drank the rain- washed air 
among the round gardenia-pods and huge bananaleaves. 
on the old wall, said the priest, were buddhas finely painted, 
and he brought a light and showed me, and i called them wonderful 
he spread the bed, dusted the mats, and made my supper ready, 
and, though the food was coarse, it satisfied my hunger. 
at midnight, while i lay there not hearing even an insect, 
the mountain moon with her pure light entered my door.... 
at dawn i left the mountain and, alone, lost my way: 
in and out, up and down, while a heavy mist 
made brook and mountain green and purple, brightening everything. 
i am passing sometimes pines and oaks, which ten men could not girdle, 
i am treading pebbles barefoot in swift-running water -- 
its ripples purify my ear, while a soft wind blows my garments.... 
these are the things which, in themselves, make life happy. 
why should we be hemmed about and hampered with people? 
o chosen pupils, far behind me in my own country, 
what if i spent my old age here and never went back home?

on the festival of the moon 
to sub-official zhang
the fine clouds have opened and the river of stars is gone, 
a clear wind blows across the sky, and the moon widens its wave, 
the sand is smooth, the water still, no sound and no shadow, 
as i offer you a cup of wine, asking you to sing. 
but so sad is this song of yours and so bitter your voice 
that before i finish listening my tears have become a rain: 
"where lake dongting is joined to the sky by the lofty nine-doubt mountain, 
dragons, crocodiles, rise and sink, apes, flying foxes, whimper.... 
at a ten to one risk of death, i have reached my official post, 
where lonely i live and hushed, as though i were in hiding. 
i leave my bed, afraid of snakes; i eat, fearing poisons; 
the air of the lake is putrid, breathing its evil odours.... 
yesterday, by the district office, the great drum was announcing 
the crowning of an emperor, a change in the realm. 
the edict granting pardons runs three hundred miles a day, 
all those who were to die have had their sentences commuted, 
the unseated are promoted and exiles are recalled, 
corruptions are abolished, clean officers appointed. 
my superior sent my name in but the governor would not listen 
and has only transferred me to this barbaric place. 
my rank is very low and useless to refer to; 
they might punish me with lashes in the dust of the street. 
most of my fellow exiles are now returning home -- 
a journey which, to me, is a heaven beyond climbing." 
...stop your song, i beg you, and listen to mine, 
a song that is utterly different from yours:

谒衡岳庙遂宿岳寺题门楼
五岳祭秩皆三公， 四方环镇嵩当中。 
火维地荒足妖怪， 天假神柄专其雄。 
喷云泄雾藏半腹， 虽有绝顶谁能穷？ 
我来正逢秋雨节， 阴气晦昧无清风。 
潜心默祷若有应， 岂非正直能感通？ 
须臾静扫众峰出， 仰见突兀撑青空。 
紫盖连延接天柱， 石廪腾掷堆祝融。 
森然魄动下马拜， 松柏一迳趋灵宫。 
纷墙丹柱动光彩， 鬼物图画填青红。 
升阶伛偻荐脯酒， 欲以菲薄明其衷。 
庙内老人识神意， 睢盱侦伺能鞠躬。 
手持杯珓导我掷， 云此最吉余难同。 
窜逐蛮荒幸不死， 衣食才足甘长终。 
侯王将相望久绝， 神纵欲福难为功。 
夜投佛寺上高阁， 星月掩映云曈昽。 
猿鸣钟动不知曙， 杲杲寒日生于东。

stopping at a temple on heng mountain i 
inscribe this poem in the gate-tower
the five holy mountains have the rank of the three dukes. 
the other four make a ring, with the song mountain midmost. 
to this one, in the fire-ruled south, where evil signs are rife, 
heaven gave divine power, ordaining it a peer. 
all the clouds and hazes are hidden in its girdle; 
and its forehead is beholden only by a few. 
...i came here in autumn, during the rainy season, 
when the sky was overcast and the clear wind gone. 
i quieted my mind and prayed, hoping for an answer; 
for assuredly righteous thinking reaches to high heaven. 
and soon all the mountain-peaks were showing me their faces; 
i looked up at a pinnacle that held the clean blue sky: 
the wide purple-canopy joined the celestial column; 
the stone granary leapt, while the fire god stood still. 
moved by this token, i dismounted to offer thanks. 
a long path of pine and cypress led to the temple. 
its white walls and purple pillars shone, and the vivid colour 
of gods and devils filled the place with patterns of red and blue. 
i climbed the steps and, bending down to sacrifice, besought 
that my pure heart might be welcome, in spite of my humble offering. 
the old priest professed to know the judgment of the god: 
he was polite and reverent, making many bows. 
he handed me divinity-cups, he showed me how to use them 
and told me that my fortune was the very best of all. 
though exiled to a barbarous land, mine is a happy life. 
plain food and plain clothes are all i ever wanted. 
to be prince, duke, premier, general, was never my desire; 
and if the god would bless me, what better could he grant than this ? -- 
at night i lie down to sleep in the top of a high tower; 
while moon and stars glimmer through the darkness of the clouds.... 
apes call, a bell sounds. and ready for dawn 
i see arise, far in the east the cold bright sun.

石鼓歌
张生手持石鼓文， 劝我识作石鼓歌。 
少陵无人谪仙死， 才薄将奈石鼓何？ 
周纲淩迟四海沸， 宣王愤起挥天戈； 
大开明堂受朝贺， 诸侯剑佩鸣相磨。 
搜于岐阳骋雄俊， 万里禽兽皆遮罗。 
镌功勒成告万世， 凿石作鼓隳嵯峨。 
从臣才艺咸第一， 拣选撰刻留山阿。 
雨淋日炙野火燎， 鬼物守护烦撝呵。 
公从何处得纸本？ 毫发尽备无差讹。 
辞严义密读难晓， 字体不类隶与蝌。 
年深岂免有缺画？ 快剑砍断生蛟鼍。 
鸾翔凤翥众仙下， 珊瑚碧树交枝柯。 
金绳铁索锁钮壮， 古鼎跃水龙腾梭。 
陋儒编诗不收入， 二雅褊迫无委蛇。 
孔子西行不到秦， 掎摭星宿遗羲娥。 
嗟予好古生苦晚， 对此涕泪双滂沱。 
忆昔初蒙博士徵， 其年始改称元和。 
故人从军在右辅， 为我度量掘臼科。 
濯冠沐浴告祭酒， 如此至宝存岂多？ 
毡包席裹可立致， 十鼓祇载数骆驼。 
荐诸太庙比郜鼎， 光价岂止百倍过。 
圣恩若许留太学， 诸生讲解得切磋。 
观经鸿都尚填咽， 坐见举国来奔波。 
剜苔剔藓露节角， 安置妥帖平不颇。 
大厦深檐与盖覆， 经历久远期无佗。 
中朝大官老于事， 讵肯感激徒媕婀？ 
牧童敲火牛砺角， 谁复著手为摩挲？ 
日销月铄就埋没， 六年西顾空吟哦。 
羲之俗书趁姿媚， 数纸尚可博白鹅。 
继周八代争战罢， 无人收拾理则那。 
方今太平日无事， 柄任儒术崇丘轲。 
安能以此上论列？ 愿借辩口如悬河。 
石鼓之歌止于此， 呜呼吾意其蹉跎。

a poem on the stone drums
chang handed me this tracing, from the stone drums, 
beseeching me to write a poem on the stone drums. 
du fu has gone. li bai is dead. 
what can my poor talent do for the stone drums? 
...when the zhou power waned and china was bubbling, 
emperor xuan, up in wrath, waved his holy spear: 
and opened his great audience, receiving all the tributes 
of kings and lords who came to him with a tune of clanging weapons. 
they held a hunt in qiyang and proved their marksmanship: 
fallen birds and animals were strewn three thousand miles. 
and the exploit was recorded, to inform new generations.... 
cut out of jutting cliffs, these drums made of stone- 
on which poets and artisans, all of the first order, 
had indited and chiselled-were set in the deep mountains 
to be washed by rain, baked by sun, burned by wildfire, 
eyed by evil spirits; and protected by the gods. 
...where can he have found the tracing on this paper? -- 
true to the original, not altered by a hair, 
the meaning deep, the phrases cryptic, difficult to read. 
and the style of the characters neither square nor tadpole. 
time has not yet vanquished the beauty of these letters -- 
looking like sharp daggers that pierce live crocodiles, 
like phoenix-mates dancing, like angels hovering down, 
like trees of jade and coral with interlocking branches, 
like golden cord and iron chain tied together tight, 
like incense-tripods flung in the sea, like dragons mounting heaven. 
historians, gathering ancient poems, forgot to gather these, 
to make the two books of musical song more colourful and striking; 
confucius journeyed in the west, but not to the qin kingdom, 
he chose our planet and our stars but missed the sun and moon 
i who am fond of antiquity, was born too late 
and, thinking of these wonderful things, cannot hold back my tears.... 
i remember, when i was awarded my highest degree, 
during the first year of yuanho, 
how a friend of mine, then at the western camp, 
offered to assist me in removing these old relics. 
i bathed and changed, then made my plea to the college president 
and urged on him the rareness of these most precious things. 
they could be wrapped in rugs, be packed and sent in boxes 
and carried on only a few camels: ten stone drums 
to grace the imperial temple like the incense-pot of gao -- 
or their lustre and their value would increase a hundredfold, 
if the monarch would present them to the university, 
where students could study them and doubtless decipher them, 
and multitudes, attracted to the capital of culture 
prom all corners of the empire, would be quick to gather. 
we could scour the moss, pick out the dirt, restore the original surface, 
and lodge them in a fitting and secure place for ever, 
covered by a massive building with wide eaves 
where nothing more might happen to them as it had before. 
...but government officials grow fixed in their ways 
and never will initiate beyond old precedent; 
so herd- boys strike the drums for fire, cows polish horns on them, 
with no one to handle them reverentially. 
still ageing and decaying, soon they may be effaced. 
six years i have sighed for them, chanting toward the west.... 
the familiar script of wang xizhi, beautiful though it was, 
could be had, several pages, just for a few white geese, 
but now, eight dynasties after the zhou, and all the wars over, 
why should there be nobody caring for these drums? 
the empire is at peace, the government free. 
poets again are honoured and confucians and mencians.... 
oh, how may this petition be carried to the throne? 
it needs indeed an eloquent flow, like a cataract- 
but, alas, my voice has broken, in my song of the stone drums, 
to a sound of supplication choked with its own tears.

...i turn and see the waves moving as from heaven,

长恨歌
汉皇重色思倾国， 御宇多年求不得。 
杨家有女初长成， 养在深闺人未识。 
天生丽质难自弃， 一朝选在君王侧； 
回眸一笑百媚生， 六宫粉黛无颜色。 
春寒赐浴华清池， 温泉水滑洗凝脂； 
侍儿扶起娇无力， 始是新承恩泽时。 
云鬓花颜金步摇， 芙蓉帐暖度春宵； 
春宵苦短日高起， 从此君王不早朝。 
承欢侍宴无闲暇， 春从春游夜专夜。 
后宫佳丽三千人， 三千宠爱在一身。 
金星妆成娇侍夜， 玉楼宴罢醉和春。 
姊妹弟兄皆列士， 可怜光彩生门户； 
遂令天下父母心， 不重生男重生女。 
骊宫高处入青云， 仙乐风飘处处闻； 
缓歌慢舞凝丝竹， 尽日君王看不足。 
渔阳鼙鼓动地来， 惊破霓裳羽衣曲。 
九重城阙烟尘生， 千乘万骑西南行。 
翠华摇摇行复止， 西出都门百余里。 
六军不发无奈何？ 宛转蛾眉马前死。 
花钿委地无人收， 翠翘金雀玉搔头。 
君王掩面救不得， 回看血泪相和流。 
黄埃散漫风萧索， 云栈萦纡登剑阁。 
峨嵋山下少人行， 旌旗无光日色薄。 
蜀江水碧蜀山青， 圣主朝朝暮暮情。 
行宫见月伤心色， 夜雨闻铃肠断声。 
天旋地转回龙驭， 到此踌躇不能去。 
马嵬坡下泥土中， 不见玉颜空死处。 
君臣相顾尽沾衣， 东望都门信马归。 
归来池苑皆依旧， 太液芙蓉未央柳； 
芙蓉如面柳如眉， 对此如何不泪垂？ 
春风桃李花开日， 秋雨梧桐叶落时。 
西宫南内多秋草， 落叶满阶红不扫。 
梨园子弟白发新， 椒房阿监青娥老。 
夕殿萤飞思悄然， 孤灯挑尽未成眠。 
迟迟钟鼓初长夜， 耿耿星河欲曙天。 
鸳鸯瓦冷霜华重， 翡翠衾寒谁与共？ 
悠悠生死别经年， 魂魄不曾来入梦。 
临邛道士鸿都客， 能以精诚致魂魄； 
为感君王辗转思， 遂教方士殷勤觅。 
排空驭气奔如电， 升天入地求之遍； 
上穷碧落下黄泉， 两处茫茫皆不见。 
忽闻海上有仙山， 山在虚无缥缈间； 
楼阁玲珑五云起， 其中绰约多仙子。 
中有一人字太真， 雪肤花貌参差是。 
金阙西厢叩玉扃， 转教小玉报双成。 
闻道汉家天子使， 九华帐里梦魂惊。 
揽衣推枕起徘徊， 珠箔银屏迤逦开， 
云鬓半偏新睡觉， 花冠不整下堂来。 
风吹仙袂飘飘举， 犹似霓裳羽衣舞； 
玉容寂寞泪阑干， 梨花一枝春带雨。 
含情凝睇谢君王， 一别音容两渺茫。 
昭阳殿里恩爱绝， 蓬莱宫中日月长。 
回头下望人寰处， 不见长安见尘雾。 
唯将旧物表深情， 钿合金钗寄将去。 
钗留一股合一扇， 钗擘黄金合分钿； 
但教心似金钿坚， 天上人间会相见。 
临别殷勤重寄词， 词中有誓两心知。 
七月七日长生殿， 夜半无人私语时。 
在天愿作比翼鸟， 在地愿为连理枝。 
天长地久有时尽， 此恨绵绵无绝期。

bai juyi
a song of unending sorrow
chinas emperor, craving beauty that might shake an empire, 
was on the throne for many years, searching, never finding, 
till a little child of the yang clan, hardly even grown, 
bred in an inner chamber, with no one knowing her, 
but with graces granted by heaven and not to be concealed, 
at last one day was chosen for the imperial household. 
if she but turned her head and smiled, there were cast a hundred spells, 
and the powder and paint of the six palaces faded into nothing. 
...it was early spring. they bathed her in the flowerpure pool, 
which warmed and smoothed the creamy-tinted crystal of her skin, 
and, because of her languor, a maid was lifting her 
when first the emperor noticed her and chose her for his bride. 
the cloud of her hair, petal of her cheek, gold ripples of her crown when she moved, 
were sheltered on spring evenings by warm hibiscus curtains; 
but nights of spring were short and the sun arose too soon, 
and the emperor, from that time forth, forsook his early hearings 
and lavished all his time on her with feasts and revelry, 
his mistress of the spring, his despot of the night. 
there were other ladies in his court, three thousand of rare beauty, 
but his favours to three thousand were concentered in one body. 
by the time she was dressed in her golden chamber, it would be almost evening; 
and when tables were cleared in the tower of jade, she would loiter, slow with wine. 
her sisters and her brothers all were given titles; 
and, because she so illumined and glorified her clan, 
she brought to every father, every mother through the empire, 
happiness when a girl was born rather than a boy. 
...high rose li palace, entering blue clouds, 
and far and wide the breezes carried magical notes 
of soft song and slow dance, of string and bamboo music. 
the emperors eyes could never gaze on her enough- 
till war-drums, booming from yuyang, shocked the whole earth 
and broke the tunes of the rainbow skirt and the feathered coat. 
the forbidden city, the nine-tiered palace, loomed in the dust 
from thousands of horses and chariots headed southwest. 
the imperial flag opened the way, now moving and now pausing- - 
but thirty miles from the capital, beyond the western gate, 
the men of the army stopped, not one of them would stir 
till under their horses hoofs they might trample those moth- eyebrows.... 
flowery hairpins fell to the ground, no one picked them up, 
and a green and white jade hair-tassel and a yellowgold hair- bird. 
the emperor could not save her, he could only cover his face. 
and later when he turned to look, the place of blood and tears 
was hidden in a yellow dust blown by a cold wind. 
... at the cleft of the dagger-tower trail they crisscrossed through a cloud-line 
under omei mountain. the last few came. 
flags and banners lost their colour in the fading sunlight.... 
but as waters of shu are always green and its mountains always blue, 
so changeless was his majestys love and deeper than the days. 
he stared at the desolate moon from his temporary palace. 
he heard bell-notes in the evening rain, cutting at his breast. 
and when heaven and earth resumed their round and the dragon car faced home, 
the emperor clung to the spot and would not turn away 
from the soil along the mawei slope, under which was buried 
that memory, that anguish. where was her jade-white face? 
ruler and lords, when eyes would meet, wept upon their coats 
as they rode, with loose rein, slowly eastward, back to the capital. 
...the pools, the gardens, the palace, all were just as before, 
the lake taiye hibiscus, the weiyang palace willows; 
but a petal was like her face and a willow-leaf her eyebrow -- 
and what could he do but cry whenever he looked at them? 
...peach-trees and plum-trees blossomed, in the winds of spring; 
lakka-foliage fell to the ground, after autumn rains; 
the western and southern palaces were littered with late grasses, 
and the steps were mounded with red leaves that no one swept away. 
her pear-garden players became white-haired 
and the eunuchs thin-eyebrowed in her court of peppertrees; 
over the throne flew fire-flies, while he brooded in the twilight. 
he would lengthen the lamp-wick to its end and still could never sleep. 
bell and drum would slowly toll the dragging nighthours 
and the river of stars grow sharp in the sky, just before dawn, 
and the porcelain mandarin-ducks on the roof grow thick with morning frost 
and his covers of kingfisher-blue feel lonelier and colder 
with the distance between life and death year after year; 
and yet no beloved spirit ever visited his dreams. 
...at lingqiong lived a taoist priest who was a guest of heaven, 
able to summon spirits by his concentrated mind. 
and people were so moved by the emperors constant brooding 
that they besought the taoist priest to see if he could find her. 
he opened his way in space and clove the ether like lightning, 
up to heaven, under the earth, looking everywhere. 
above, he searched the green void, below, the yellow spring; 
but he failed, in either place, to find the one he looked for. 
and then he heard accounts of an enchanted isle at sea, 
a part of the intangible and incorporeal world, 
with pavilions and fine towers in the five-coloured air, 
and of exquisite immortals moving to and fro, 
and of one among them-whom they called the ever true- 
with a face of snow and flowers resembling hers he sought. 
so he went to the west halls gate of gold and knocked at the jasper door 
and asked a girl, called morsel-of-jade, to tell the doubly- perfect. 
and the lady, at news of an envoy from the emperor of china, 
was startled out of dreams in her nine-flowered, canopy. 
she pushed aside her pillow, dressed, shook away sleep, 
and opened the pearly shade and then the silver screen. 
her cloudy hair-dress hung on one side because of her great haste, 
and her flower-cap was loose when she came along the terrace, 
while a light wind filled her cloak and flutte

an old war-song
through the bright day up the mountain, we scan the sky for a war-torch; 
at yellow dusk we water our horses in the boundaryriver; 
and when the throb of watch-drums hangs in the sandy wind, 
we hear the guitar of the chinese princess telling her endless woe.... 
three thousand miles without a town, nothing but camps, 
till the heavy sky joins the wide desert in snow. 
with their plaintive calls, barbarian wildgeese fly from night to night, 
and children of the tartars have many tears to shed; 
but we hear that the jade pass is still under siege, 
and soon we stake our lives upon our light warchariots. 
each year we bury in the desert bones unnumbered, 
yet we only watch for grape-vines coming into china.

on her painted pavilions, facing red towers, 
cornices are pink and green with peach-bloom and with willow, 
canopies of silk awn her seven-scented chair, 
and rare fans shade her, home to her nine-flowered curtains. 
her lord, with rank and wealth and in the bud of life, 
exceeds in munificence the richest men of old. 
he favours this girl of lowly birth, he has her taught to dance; 
and he gives away his coral-trees to almost anyone. 
the wind of dawn just stirs when his nine soft lights go out, 
those nine soft lights like petals in a flying chain of flowers. 
between dances she has barely time for singing over the songs; 
no sooner is she dressed again than incense burns before her. 
those she knows in town are only the rich and the lavish, 
and day and night she is visiting the hosts of the gayest mansions. 
...who notices the girl from yue with a face of white jade, 
humble, poor, alone, by the river, washing silk?

wang wei
song of an old general
when he was a youth of fifteen or twenty, 
he chased a wild horse, he caught him and rode him, 
he shot the white-browed mountain tiger, 
he defied the yellow-bristled horseman of ye. 
fighting single- handed for a thousand miles, 
with his naked dagger he could hold a multitude. 
...granted that the troops of china were as swift as heavens thunder 
and that tartar soldiers perished in pitfalls fanged with iron, 
general wei qings victory was only a thing of chance. 
and general li guangs thwarted effort was his fate, not his fault. 
since this mans retirement he is looking old and worn: 
experience of the world has hastened his white hairs. 
though once his quick dart never missed the right eye of a bird, 
now knotted veins and tendons make his left arm like an osier. 
he is sometimes at the road-side selling melons from his garden, 
he is sometimes planting willows round his hermitage. 
his lonely lane is shut away by a dense grove, 
his vacant window looks upon the far cold mountains 
but, if he prayed, the waters would come gushing for his men 
and never would he wanton his cause away with wine. 
...war-clouds are spreading, under the helan range; 
back and forth, day and night, go feathered messages; 
in the three river provinces, the governors call young men -- 
and five imperial edicts have summoned the old general. 
so he dusts his iron coat and shines it like snow- 
waves his dagger from its jade hilt in a dance of starry steel. 
he is ready with his strong northern bow to smite the tartar chieftain -- 
that never a foreign war-dress may affront the emperor. 
...there once was an aged prefect, forgotten and far away, 
who still could manage triumph with a single stroke.

a song of peach-blossom river
a fisherman is drifting, enjoying the spring mountains, 
and the peach-trees on both banks lead him to an ancient source. 
watching the fresh-coloured trees, he never thinks of distance 
till he comes to the end of the blue stream and suddenly- strange men! 
its a cave-with a mouth so narrow that he has to crawl through; 
but then it opens wide again on a broad and level path -- 
and far beyond he faces clouds crowning a reach of trees, 
and thousands of houses shadowed round with flowers and bamboos.... 
woodsmen tell him their names in the ancient speech of han; 
and clothes of the qin dynasty are worn by all these people 
living on the uplands, above the wuling river, 
on farms and in gardens that are like a world apart, 
their dwellings at peace under pines in the clear moon, 
until sunrise fills the low sky with crowing and barking. 
...at news of a stranger the people all assemble, 
and each of them invites him home and asks him where he was born. 
alleys and paths are cleared for him of petals in the morning, 
and fishermen and farmers bring him their loads at dusk.... 
they had left the world long ago, they had come here seeking refuge; 
they have lived like angels ever since, blessedly far away, 
no one in the cave knowing anything outside, 
outsiders viewing only empty mountains and thick clouds. 
...the fisherman, unaware of his great good fortune, 
begins to think of country, of home, of worldly ties, 
finds his way out of the cave again, past mountains and past rivers, 
intending some time to return, when he has told his kin. 
he studies every step he takes, fixes it well in mind, 
and forgets that cliffs and peaks may vary their appearance. 
...it is certain that to enter through the deepness of the mountain, 
a green river leads you, into a misty wood. 
but now, with spring-floods everywhere and floating peachpetals -- 
which is the way to go, to find that hidden source?

蜀道难
噫吁戏， 危乎高哉！ 
蜀道之难难于上青天！ 
蚕丛及鱼凫， 开国何茫然。 
尔来四万八千岁， 始与秦塞通人烟。 
西当太白有鸟道， 可以横绝峨眉巅。 
地崩山摧壮士死， 然后天梯石栈方钩连。 
上有六龙回日之高标， 下有冲波逆折之回川。 
黄鹤之飞尚不得， 猿猱欲度愁攀援。 
青泥何盘盘， 百步九折萦岩峦， 
扪参历井仰胁息， 以手抚膺坐长叹。 
问君西游何时还？ 畏途巉岩不可攀。 
但见悲鸟号古木， 雄飞雌从绕林间； 
又闻子规啼， 夜月愁空山。 
蜀道之难难于上青天！ 
使人听此凋朱颜。 
连峰去天不盈尺， 枯松倒挂倚绝壁。 
飞湍瀑流争喧豗， 砯崖转石万壑雷。 
其险也如此！ 嗟尔远道之人， 
胡为乎来哉？ 剑阁峥嵘而崔嵬， 
一夫当关， 万夫莫开； 
所守或匪亲， 化为狼与豺， 
朝避猛虎， 夕避长蛇， 
磨牙吮血， 杀人如麻。 
锦城虽云乐， 不如早还家。 
蜀道之难难于上青天， 侧身西望常咨嗟。

hard roads in shu
oh, but it is high and very dangerous! 
such travelling is harder than scaling the blue sky. 
...until two rulers of this region 
pushed their way through in the misty ages, 
forty-eight thousand years had passed 
with nobody arriving across the qin border. 
and the great white mountain, westward, still has only a birds path 
up to the summit of emei peak -- 
which was broken once by an earthquake and there were brave men lost, 
just finishing the stone rungs of their ladder toward heaven. 
...high, as on a tall flag, six dragons drive the sun, 
while the river, far below, lashes its twisted course. 
such height would be hard going for even a yellow crane, 
so pity the poor monkeys who have only paws to use. 
the mountain of green clay is formed of many circles- 
each hundred steps, we have to turn nine turns among its mound -- 
panting, we brush orion and pass the well star, 
then, holding our chests with our hands and sinking to the ground with a groan, 
we wonder if this westward trail will never have an end. 
the formidable path ahead grows darker, darker still, 
with nothing heard but the call of birds hemmed in by the ancient forest, 
male birds smoothly wheeling, following the females; 
and there come to us the melancholy voices of the cuckoos 
out on the empty mountain, under the lonely moon.... 
such travelling is harder than scaling the blue sky. 
even to hear of it turns the cheek pale, 
with the highest crag barely a foot below heaven. 
dry pines hang, head down, from the face of the cliffs, 
and a thousand plunging cataracts outroar one another 
and send through ten thousand valleys a thunder of spinning stones. 
with all this danger upon danger, 
why do people come here who live at a safe distance? 
...though dagger-tower pass be firm and grim, 
and while one man guards it 
ten thousand cannot force it, 
what if he be not loyal, 
but a wolf toward his fellows? 
...there are ravenous tigers to fear in the day 
and venomous reptiles in the night 
with their teeth and their fangs ready 
to cut people down like hemp. 
though the city of silk be delectable, i would rather turn home quickly. 
such travelling is harder than scaling the blue sky.... 
but i still face westward with a dreary moan.

长相思， 在长安。

"i am endlessly yearning 
to be in changan. 
...insects hum of autumn by the gold brim of the well; 
a thin frost glistens like little mirrors on my cold mat; 
the high lantern flickers; and. deeper grows my longing. 
i lift the shade and, with many a sigh, gaze upon the moon, 
single as a flower, centred from the clouds. 
above, i see the blueness and deepness of sky. 
below, i see the greenness and the restlessness of water.... 
heaven is high, earth wide; bitter between them flies my sorrow. 
can i dream through the gateway, over the mountain? 
endless longing 
breaks my heart."

"the sun has set, and a mist is in the flowers;

a zhao harp has just been laid mute on its phoenix holder, 
and a shu lute begins to sound its mandarin-duck strings.... 
since nobody can bear to you the burden of my song, 
would that it might follow the spring wind to yanran mountain. 
i think of you far away, beyond the blue sky, 
and my eyes that once were sparkling 
are now a well of tears. 
...oh, if ever you should doubt this aching of my heart, 
here in my bright mirror come back and look at me!"

the hard road
pure wine costs, for the golden cup, ten thousand coppers a flagon, 
and a jade plate of dainty food calls for a million coins. 
i fling aside my food-sticks and cup, i cannot eat nor drink.... 
i pull out my dagger, i peer four ways in vain. 
i would cross the yellow river, but ice chokes the ferry; 
i would climb the taihang mountains, but the sky is blind with snow.... 
i would sit and poise a fishing-pole, lazy by a brook -- 
but i suddenly dream of riding a boat, sailing for the sun.... 
journeying is hard,

ten thousand coins for a cask of wine, with many a laugh and quip.

a song of war-chariots
the war-chariots rattle, 
the war-horses whinny. 
each man of you has a bow and a quiver at his belt. 
father, mother, son, wife, stare at you going, 
till dust shall have buried the bridge beyond changan. 
they run with you, crying, they tug at your sleeves, 
and the sound of their sorrow goes up to the clouds; 
and every time a bystander asks you a question, 
you can only say to him that you have to go. 
...we remember others at fifteen sent north to guard the river 
and at forty sent west to cultivate the campfarms. 
the mayor wound their turbans for them when they started out. 
with their turbaned hair white now, they are still at the border, 
at the border where the blood of men spills like the sea -- 
and still the heart of emperor wu is beating for war. 
...do you know that, east of chinas mountains, in two hundred districts 
and in thousands of villages, nothing grows but weeds, 
and though strong women have bent to the ploughing, 
east and west the furrows all are broken down? 
...men of china are able to face the stiffest battle, 
but their officers drive them like chickens and dogs. 
whatever is asked of them, 
dare they complain? 
for example, this winter 
held west of the gate, 
challenged for taxes, 
how could they pay? 
...we have learned that to have a son is bad luck- 
it is very much better to have a daughter 
who can marry and live in the house of a neighbour, 
while under the sod we bury our boys. 
...go to the blue sea, look along the shore 
at all the old white bones forsaken -- 
new ghosts are wailing there now with the old, 
loudest in the dark sky of a stormy day.

a song of fair women
on the third day of the third-month in the freshening weather 
many beauties take the air by the changan waterfront, 
receptive, aloof, sweet-mannered, sincere, 
with soft fine skin and well-balanced bone. 
their embroidered silk robes in the spring sun are gleaming -- 
with a mass of golden peacocks and silver unicorns. 
and hanging far down from their temples 
are blue leaves of delicate kingfisher feathers. 
and following behind them 
is a pearl-laden train, rhythmic with bearers. 
some of them are kindred to the royal house -- 
the titled princesses guo and qin. 
red camel-humps are brought them from jade broilers, 
and sweet fish is ordered them on crystal trays. 
though their food-sticks of unicorn-horn are lifted languidly 
and the finely wrought phoenix carving-knife is very little used, 
fleet horses from the yellow gate, stirring no dust, 
bring precious dishes constantly from the imperial kitchen. 
...while a solemn sound of flutes and drums invokes gods and spirits, 
guests and courtiers gather, all of high rank; 
and finally, riding slow, a dignified horseman 
dismounts at the pavilion on an embroidered rug. 
in a snow of flying willow-cotton whitening the duckweed, 
bluebirds find their way with vermilion handkerchiefs -- 
but power can be as hot as flame and burn peoples fingers. 
be wary of the premier, watch for his frown.

i am only an old woodsman, whispering a sob, 
as i steal like a spring-shadow down the winding river. 
...since the palaces ashore are sealed by a thousand gates -- 
fine willows, new rushes, for whom are you so green? 
...i remember a cloud of flags that came from the south garden, 
and ten thousand colours, heightening one another, 
and the kingdoms first lady, from the palace of the bright sun, 
attendant on the emperor in his royal chariot, 
and the horsemen before them, each with bow and arrows, 
and the snowy horses, champing at bits of yellow gold, 
and an archer, breast skyward, shooting through the clouds 
and felling with one dart a pair of flying birds. 
...where are those perfect eyes, where are those pearly teeth? 
a blood-stained spirit has no home, has nowhere to return. 
and clear wei waters running east, through the cleft on dagger- tower trail, 
carry neither there nor here any news of her.

along the wall of the capital a white-headed crow 
flies to the gate where autumn enters and screams there in the night, 
then turns again and pecks among the roofs of a tall mansion 
whose lord, a mighty mandarin, has fled before the tartars, 
with his golden whip now broken, his nine war-horses dead 
and his own flesh and bone scattered to the winds.... 
theres a rare ring of green coral underneath the vest 
of a prince at a street-corner, bitterly sobbing, 
who has to give a false name to anyone who asks him- 
just a poor fellow, hoping for employment. 
a hundred days hiding in grasses and thorns 
show on his body from head to foot. 
but, since their first emperor, all with hooknoses, 
these dragons look different from ordinary men. 
wolves are in the palace now and dragons are lost in the desert -- 
o prince, be very careful of your most sacred person! 
i dare not address you long, here by the open road, 
nor even to stand beside you for more than these few moments. 
last night with the spring-wind there came a smell of blood; 
the old capital is full of camels from the east. 
our northern warriors are sound enough of body and of hand -- 
oh, why so brave in olden times and so craven now? 
our emperor, we hear, has given his son the throne 
and the southern border-chieftains are loyally inclined 
and the huamen and limian tribes are gathering to avenge us. 
but still be careful-keep yourself well hidden from the dagger. 
unhappy prince, i beg you, be constantly on guard -- 
till power blow to your aid from the five imperial tombs.

here turn back, this very month.... 
shall my own southward journey 
ever be retraced, i wonder? 
...the river is pausing at ebb-tide, 
and the woods are thick with clinging mist -- 
but tomorrow morning, over the mountain, 
dawn will be white with the plum-trees of home.

a mooring under north fort hill
under blue mountains we wound our way, 
my boat and 1, along green water; 
until the banks at low tide widened, 
with no wind stirring my lone sail. 
...night now yields to a sea of sun, 
and the old year melts in freshets. 
at last i can send my messengers -- 
wildgeese, homing to loyang.

a buddhist retreat behind broken-mountain temple
in the pure morning, near the old temple, 
where early sunlight points the tree-tops, 
my path has wound, through a sheltered hollow 
of boughs and flowers, to a buddhist retreat. 
here birds are alive with mountain-light, 
and the mind of man touches peace in a pool, 
and a thousand sounds are quieted 
by the breathing of a temple-bell.

a message to censor du fu 
at his office in the left court
together we officials climbed vermilion steps, 
to be parted by the purple walls.... 
our procession, which entered the palace at dawn,

or blue clouds envy a lilting bird; 
but this reign is of heaven, nothing goes wrong, 
there have been almost no petitions.

master, i hail you from my heart,

the sun is tempered by green pines.... 
and at twilight, close to an emptying pool, 
thought can conquer the passion-dragon.

罢归无旧业， 老去恋明时。 
独立三边静， 轻生一剑知。 
茫茫江汉上， 日暮复何之。

liu chanqing
a farewell to governor li 
on his way home to hanyang
sad wanderer, once you conquered the south, 
commanding a hundred thousand men; 
today, dismissed and dispossessed, 
in your old age you remember glory. 
once, when you stood, three borders were still; 
your dagger was the scale of life. 
now, watching the great rivers, the jiang and the han, 
on their ways in the evening, where do you go?

饯别王十一南游
望君烟水阔， 挥手泪沾巾。 
飞鸟没何处？ 青山空向人。 
长江一帆远， 落日五湖春。 
谁见汀洲上， 相思愁白苹？ 
five-character-regular-verse
liu changing
on seeing wang leave for the south
toward a mist upon the water 
still i wave my hand and sob, 
for the flying bird is lost in space 
beyond a desolate green mountain.... 
but now the long river, the far lone sail, 
five lakes, gleam like spring in the sunset; 
and down an island white with duckweed 
comes the quiet of communion.

five-character-regular-verse
liu changing
while visiting on the south stream 
the taoist priest chang
walking along a little path, 
i find a footprint on the moss, 
a while cloud low on the quiet lake, 
grasses that sweeten an idle door, 
a pine grown greener with the rain, 
a brook that comes from a mountain source -- 
and, mingling with truth among the flowers, 
i have forgotten what to say.

liu changqing
new years at changsha
new years only deepens my longing, 
adds to the lonely tears of an exile 
who, growing old and still in harness, 
is left here by the homing spring.... 
monkeys come down from the mountains to haunt me. 
i bend like a willow, when it rains on the river. 
i think of jia yi, who taught here and died here-
and i wonder what my term shall be.

farewell to a japanese buddhist priest 
bound homeward
you were foreordained to find the source. 
now, tracing your way as in a dream 
there where the sea floats up the sky, 
you wane from the world in your fragile boat.... 
the water and the moon are as calm as your faith, 
fishes and dragons follow your chanting, 
and the eye still watches beyond the horizon 
the holy light of your single lantern.

from my study at the mouth of the valley. 
a message to censor yang
at a little grass-hut in the valley of the river, 
where a cloud seems born from a viney wall, 
you will love the bamboos new with rain, 
and mountains tender in the sunset. 
cranes drift early here to rest 
and autumn flowers are slow to fade.... 
i have bidden my pupil to sweep the grassy path 
for the coming of my friend.

wei yingwu
a greeting on the huai river 
to my old friends from liangchuan
we used to be companions on the jiang and the han, 
and as often as we met, we were likely to be tipsy. 
since we left one another, floating apart like clouds, 
ten years have run like water-till at last we join again. 
and we talk again and laugh again just as in earlier days, 
except that the hair on our heads is tinged now with grey. 
why not come along, then, all of us together, 
and face the autumn mountains and sail along the huai?

a farewell in the evening rain to li cao
is it raining on the river all the way to chu? -- - 
the evening bell comes to us from nanjing. 
your wet sail drags and is loath to be going 
and shadowy birds are flying slow. 
we cannot see the deep ocean-gate -- 
only the boughs at pukou, newly dripping. 
likewise, because of our great love, 
there are threads of water on our faces.

an autumn evening harmonizing 
cheng qins poem
while a cold wind is creeping under my mat, 
and the citys naked wall grows pale with the autumn moon, 
i see a lone wild-goose crossing the river of stars, 
and i hear, on stone in the night, thousands of washing mallets.... 
but, instead of wishing the season, as it goes, 
to bear me also far away, 
i have found your poem so beautiful 
that i forget the homing birds.

a poem
on a road outreaching the white clouds, 
by a spring outrunning the bluest river, 
petals come drifting on the wind

my quiet gate is a mountain-trail, 
and the willow-trees about my cottage 
sift on my sleeve, through the shadowy noon, 
distillations of the sun.

changing on old friends in a village inn
while the autumn moon is pouring full 
on a thousand night-levels among towns and villages, 
there meet by chance, south of the river, 
dreaming doubters of a dream.... 
in the trees a wind has startled the birds, 
and insects cower from cold in the grass; 
but wayfarers at least have wine 
and nothing to fear -- till the morning bell.

a farewell to li duan
by my old gate, among yellow grasses, 
still we linger, sick at heart. 
the way you must follow through cold clouds

your father died; you left home young; 
nobody knew of your misfortunes. 
we cry, we say nothing. what can i wish you, 
in this blowing wintry world?

a brief but happy meeting with my brother-in law 
"meeting by accident, only to part"
after these ten torn wearisome years 
we have met again. we were both so changed 
that hearing first your surname, i thought you a stranger -- 
then hearing your given name, i remembered your young face.... 
all that has happened with the tides 
we have told and told till the evening bell.... 
tomorrow you journey to youzhou, 
leaving autumn between us, peak after peak.

a farewell to han shen at the yunyang inn
long divided by river and sea, 
for years we two have failed to meet -- 
and suddenly to find you seems like a dream.... 
with a catch in the throat, we ask how old we are. 
...our single lamp shines, through cold and wet, 
on a bamboo- thicket sheathed in rain; 
but forgetting the sadness that will come with tomorrow, 
let us share the comfort of this farewell wine.

there are shivering birds and withering grasses, 
whichever way i turn my face.

you were the firmest of the pots three legs;

to dance in the palace of the king of wei.

if only i knew, i might serve you in the temple, 
instead of these tears toward the far sky.

i am shut in with loneliness and grief. 
under the cold lamp, i brood on the past; 
i am kept awake by a lost wildgoose.

and i remember the moon like smoke on the river 
and a fisher-boat moored there, under my door.

inscribed in the inn at tong gate 
on an autumn trip to the capital
red leaves are fluttering down the twilight 
past this arbour where i take my wine; 
cloud-rifts are blowing toward great flower mountain,

i can see trees colouring a distant wall. 
i can hear the river seeking the sea, 
as i the imperial city tomorrow -- 
but i dream of woodsmen and fishermen.

early autumn
theres a harp in the midnight playing clear, 
while the west wind rustles a green vine; 
theres a low cloud touching the jade-white dew 
and an early wildgoose in the river of stars.... 
night in the tall trees clings to dawn; 
light makes folds in the distant hills; 
and here on the huai, by one falling leaf, 
i can feel a storm on lake dongting.

my road has wound through many years.

i cry out from my heart for xinfeng wine 
to melt away my thousand woes.

falling petals
gone is the guest from the chamber of rank,

hearts fragrance is spent with the ending of spring 
and nothing left but a tear-stained robe.

i lean full-weight on my slender staff 
how within this world, within this grain of dust, 
can there be any room for the passions of men?

thoughts of old time 
on the chu river
a cold light shines on the gathering dew,

trees echo with monkeys on the banks of lake dongting,

marsh-lands are swollen wide with the moon, 
while torrents are bent to the mountains will; 
and the vanished queens of the clouds leave me 
sad with autumn all night long.

though a bugle breaks the crystal air of autumn, 
soldiers, in the look-out, watch at ease today 
the spring wind blowing across green graves

the border is open to travel again; 
and tartars can no more choose than rivers: 
they are running, all of them, toward the south.

along the wall toward the cold moon. 
...if they caught you in a net or with a shot, 
would it be worse than flying alone?

i waited to ask your western neighbour; 
but he told me that daily you climb the mountain, 
never returning until sunset.

the great flowers three points pierce through heaven. 
clouds are parting above the temple of the warring emperor, 
rain dries on the mountain, on the giants palm. 
ranges and rivers are the strength of this western gate, 
whence roads and trails lead downward into china. 
...o pilgrim of fame, o seeker of profit, 
why not remain here and lengthen your days?

at this lofty tower where the town ends, wilderness begins; 
and our longing has as far to go as the ocean or the sky.... 
hibiscus-flowers by the moat heave in a sudden wind, 
and vines along the wall are whipped with slanting rain. 
nothing to see for three hundred miles but a blur of woods and mountain -- 
and the rivers nine loops, twisting in our bowels.... 
this is where they have sent us, this land of tattooed people -- 
and not even letters, to keep us in touch with home.

刘禹锡
西塞山怀古
王浚楼船下益州， 金陵王气黯然收。 
千寻铁锁沈江底， 一片降旛出石头。 
人世几回伤往事， 山形依旧枕寒流。 
从今四海为家日， 故垒萧萧芦荻秋。

liu yuxi
thoughts of old time at west fort mountain
since wang jun brought his towering ships down from yizhou, 
the royal ghost has pined in the city of nanjing. 
ten thousand feet of iron chain were sunk here to the bottom -- 
and then came the flag of surrender on the wall of stone.... 
cycles of change have moved into the past, 
while still this mountain dignity has commanded the cold river; 
and now comes the day of the chinese world united, 
and the old forts fill with ruin and with autumn reeds.

o youngest, best-loved daughter of xie, 
who unluckily married this penniless scholar, 
you patched my clothes from your own wicker basket, 
and i coaxed off your hairpins of gold, to buy wine with; 
for dinner we had to pick wild herbs --

...today they are paying me a hundred thousand -- 
and all that i can bring to you is a temple sacrifice.

but not as those know it who have been poor together.

there have been better men than i to whom heaven denied a son, 
there was a poet better than i whose dead wife could not hear him.

to my brothers and sisters adrift 
in troubled times this poem of the moon 
since the disorders in henan and the famine in guannei, my brothers and sisters have been scattered. looking at the moon, i express my thoughts in this poem, which i send to my eldest brother at fuliang, my seventh brother at yuqian, my fifteen brother at wujiang and my younger brothers and sisters at fuli and xiagui.
my heritage lost through disorder and famine, 
my brothers and sisters flung eastward and westward, 
my fields and gardens wrecked by the war, 
my own flesh and blood become scum of the street, 
i moan to my shadow like a lone-wandering wildgoose, 
i am torn from my root like a water-plant in autumn: 
i gaze at the moon, and my tears run down 
for hearts, in five places, all sick with one wish.

the spring-heart of emperor wang is crying in a cuckoo,

has come and gone before i knew.

and the river of heaven slants and the morning stars are low, 
are you sorry for having stolen the potion that has set you 
over purple seas and blue skies, to brood through the long nights?

when the emperor sought guidance from wise men, from exiles, 
he found no calmer wisdom than that of young jia 
and assigned him the foremost council-seat at midnight, 
yet asked him about gods, instead of about people.

wen tingyun
she sighs on her jade lute
a cool-matted silvery bed; but no dreams.... 
an evening sky as green as water, shadowed with tender clouds; 
but far off over the southern rivers the calling of a wildgoose, 
and here a twelve-story building, lonely under the moon.

zheng tian
on mawei slope
when the emperor came back from his ride they had murdered lady yang -- 
that passion unforgettable through all the suns and moons 
they had led him to forsake her by reminding him 
of an emperor slain with his lady once, in a well at jingyang palace.

cooler weather
her jade-green alcove curtained thick with silk,

wei zhuang
a nanjing landscape
though a shower bends the river-grass, a bird is singing,

thinking only of their vow that they would crush the tartars- - 
on the desert, clad in sable and silk, five thousand of them fell.... 
but arisen from their crumbling bones on the banks of the river at the border, 
dreams of them enter, like men alive, into rooms where their loves lie sleeping.

wumingshi
the day of no fire
as the holiday approaches, and grasses are bright after rain, 
and the causeway gleams with willows, and wheatfields wave in the wind, 
we are thinking of our kinsfolk, far away from us. 
o cuckoo, why do you follow us, why do you call us home?

folk-song-styled-verse
wang changling
a sigh in the court of perpetual faith
she brings a broom at dawn to the golden palace doorway 
and dusts the hall from end to end with her round fan, 
and, for all her jade-whiteness, she envies a crow 
whose cold wings are kindled in the court of the bright sun.

over the border
the moon goes back to the time of qin, the wall to the time of han,

where a yellow river climbs to the white clouds,

a tartar under the willows is lamenting on his flute 
that spring never blows to him through the jade pass

her robe is a cloud, her face a flower;
