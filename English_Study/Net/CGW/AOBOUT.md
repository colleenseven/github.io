'Creative & [[Graphical]] Works' (CGW) [[Studio]] is an Art & Design and Research [[studio]].


CGW [[Studio]] can provide creative strategy / art direction and design services. CGW [[Studio]] makes digital and non-digital artefacts. These include, not [[mutually]] [[exclusive]] — (i) [[graphic|graphics]] / visual artworks / [[illustration|illustrations]] (ii) [[graphical]] digital [[interface|interfaces]] and (iii) image and text publications.

CGW [[Studio]] can also provide related services, such as art/design [[consultancy]] and research for application, for different work areas. 

CGW [[Studio]] offers distinct knowledge, experience and skills in Art & Design, digital media and applied research. CGW applies an artistic [[approach]] — with a distinct geographical emphasis — to research and creative publication.

​​

Core aspects of CGW's [[methodology]] are — (i) inter- and cross-[[disciplinary]] research that [[fuse|fuses]] creative and analytical approaches for application; and (ii) '[[illustration]]' as researching and making visual artworks which work together with written words in digital and physical, [[spatial]] environments, combining digital and other media.
