Glen has travelled extensively producing artistic material on location and these artworks in this [[Gallery]] are the result of some of this work. These artworks — and the [[Gallery]] [[narrative]] — show diverse locations and a stylistically varied body of work.  These pictures evidence differing degrees of experimentation; as such this work does not necessarily [[conform]] to more [[prescriptive]], [[pictorial]] [[convention|conventions]].  Glen intends to reach a broader audience through (i) exhibiting different styles, techniques and [[aesthetics]]; and (ii) [[portray|portraying]] varied subject-matter, within the parameters of the outlined themes.

The theme of each [[gallery]] chapter (links above) is not [[mutually]] [[exclusive]] to that of another chapter: many artworks connect a number of themes.  Each [[gallery]] concept complements the  broader themes of travel, [[ecology]] and environmental diversity that run [[loosely]] through 'Geo-[[Graphical]] Artworks: Digital [[illustration|Illustrations]] by Glen Taylor'.

​
