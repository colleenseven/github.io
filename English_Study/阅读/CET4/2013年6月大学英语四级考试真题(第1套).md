**Surviving the [[recession]]**

America’s [[recession]] began quietly at the end of 2007. Since then it has [[evolve|evolved]] into a global [[crisis]]. [[Reasonable]] people may disagree about whom to blame. [[Financier|Financiers]] who were not as clever as they thought they were? [[Regulator|Regulators]] falling asleep at work? [[consumer|Consumers]] who borrowed too much? [[Politician|Politicians]] who thoughtlessly [[promote|promoted]] home-ownership for those who could not afford it? All are [[guilty]]; and what a mess they have created.

Since 2007 America has [[shed]] 5 million jobs. More than 15% of the [[workforce]] are jobless or underemployed—[[roughly]] 25 million workers. The only industries [[swelling]] their [[payroll|payrolls]] are health care, [[utility|utilities]] and the [[federal]] government. The value of listed shares in American firms [[collapse|collapsed]] by 57% from its [[peak]] in October 2007 to a low in March this year, though it has since [[bounce|bounced]] back somewhat. Industrial production fell by 12.8% in the year to March, the worst slide since the Second World War. Mark Zandi, an economist at Moody’s Economy.com, predicts that the [[recession]] will [[shrink]] America’s economy by 3.5% in total. For most [[executive|executives]], this is the worst business environment they’ve ever seen.

Times are so tough that even bosses are taking pay cuts. _[[Median]]_ (中位数的) pay for chief [[executive|executives]] of S&P 500 companies fell 6.8% in 2008. The [[overthrow|overthrown]] business [[giant|giants]] of Wall Street took the biggest knock, with average pay cuts of 38% and [[Median]] [[bonus|bonuses]] of zero. But there was some pain for everyone: [[Median]] pay for chief [[executive|executives]] of non-financial firms in the S&P 500 fell by 2.7%.

Nearly every business has a sad tale to tell. For example, Arne Sorenson, the president of Marriott hotels, [[liken|likens]] the [[crisis]] to the [[downturn]] that hit his business after September 11th, 2001. When the twin towers fell, Americans stopped travelling. Marriott had its worst quarter ever, with [[revenue|revenues]] per room falling by 25%. This year, without a terrorist attack, the hotel industry is “putting the same numbers on the board”, says Mr Sorenson.

The hotel _[[bust]]_ (不景气), like most [[bust|busts]], was [[precede|preceded]] by a [[breathtaking]] boom. Although many other big firms [[resist|resisted]] the [[temptation]] to over-borrow, developers borrowed heavily and built bigger and [[fancier]] hotels as if the whole world were planning a holiday in Las Vegas. When the [[bubble]] burst, demand [[collapse|collapsed]]. Hotel owners found themselves with a huge number of empty rooms even as a lot of unnecessary new hotels were ready to open.

Other industries have suffered even more. Large numbers of builders, [[property]] firms and [[retailer|retailers]] have gone [[bankrupt]]. And a disaster has hit Detroit. Last year the American car industry had the [[capacity]] to make 17 million vehicles. Sales in 2009 could be barely half of that. The Big Three American carmakers—General Motors, Ford and Chrysler—[[accumulate|accumulated]] [[ruinous]] costs over the post-war years, such as gold-plated health plans and [[pension|pensions]] for workers who retired as young as 48. All three are desperately [[restructuring]]. Only Ford may survive in its current form.

Hard times breed hard feelings. Few Americans understand what caused the [[recession]]. Some are seeking _[[scapegoat|scapegoats]]_ (替罪羊). [[Politician|Politicians]] are happy to take advantage. Bosses have been [[summon 1|summoned]] to Washington to be [[scold|scolded]] on live television. The president [[condemn|condemns]] their [[greed]].

**[[extravagance|Extravagance]] (奢侈)** **is out**

Businessfolk are bending over backwards to avoid seeming [[extravagant]]. Meetings at [[resort|resorts]] are suddenly unacceptable. Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, cancelled a [[conference]] in Las Vegas at the last minute and rebooked it in San Francisco, which cost more but sounded less fun.

Anyway, the pain will eventually end. American business will regain its shine. Many firms will die, but the survivors will emerge [[lean|leaner]] and stronger than before. The financial [[sector]]’s share of the economy will [[shrink]], and stay [[shrink|shrunk]] for years to come. The importance of non-financial firms will accordingly rise, along with their ability to attract the best talent. America will [[remain]] the best place on earth to do business, so long as Barack Obama and the Democrats in Congress [[resist]] the [[temptation]] to [[interfere]] too much, and so long as organised labour does not [[overplay]] its hand.

The [[crisis]] will prove hugely _[[disruptive]]_ (破坏性的), however. Bad management techniques will be [[exposed]]. [[Necessity]] will force the [[swift]] [[adoption]] of more efficient ones. At the same time, technological _[[innovation]]_ (创新) will barely [[pause]] for breath, and two big political changes seem likely.

Mr Obama’s plan to [[curb]] carbon dioxide (CO₂) _[[emission|emissions]]_ (排放), though necessary, will be far from cost-free, whatever his sunny speeches on the subject might suggest. The shift to a low-carbon economy will help some firms, hurt others and require every organisation that uses much energy to rethink how it operates. It is harder to predict how Mr Obama’s [[propose|proposed]] reforms to the failing health-care system will turn out. If he succeeds in [[curb|curbing]] costs—a big if—it would be a huge gain for America. Some businesses will benefit but the vast bulk of the savings will be captured by workers, not their employers.

In the next couple of years the businesses that thrive will be those that are tight with costs, careful of debt, cautious with cash flow and extremely attentive to what customers want. They will include plenty of names no one has yet heard of.

Times change, and corporations change with them. In 1955 _Time_’s Man of the Year was Harlow Curtice, the boss of GM. His firm was leading America towards “a new economic order”, the magazine wrote. Thanks to men like Curtice, “the bonds of scarcity” had been broken and America was rolling “in an all-time high of prosperity”. Soon, Americans would need to spend “comparatively little time earning a living”.

Half a century later GM is a typical example of poor management. In March its chief [[executive]] was fired by _Time_’s current Man of the Year, Mr Obama. The government now backs up the domestic car industry, lending it money and overseeing its turnaround plans. With luck, this will be short-lived. But there is a danger that Washington will end up micromanaging not only Detroit but also other parts of the economy. And clever as Mr Obama’s advisers are, history suggests they will be bad at this.

**Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage.**

Just when you had figured out how to manage fat in your diet, researchers are now warning against another common mealtime _pitfall_ (陷阱) —salt.

A study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Stanford University and Columbia University shows that even a  47  decrease in daily salt _intake_ (摄入) can lead to dramatic health benefits. The authors  48  an annual drop of as many as 120,000 cases of heart disease, 66,000  49  of stroke and 99,000 heart attacks  50   by high blood pressure after a 3-g-per-day reduction in salt.

The advantages, not surprisingly, were greater for African Americans, who are more likely to 51  high blood pressure than other ethnic groups, and for the elderly, since blood vessels stiffen with age, which can lead to higher blood pressure.

“Everyone in the U.S. is consuming salt far in  52  of what is good for them,” says lead author Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo of UCSF. “What we are suggesting is that a population-wide effort to reduce salt intake, even   53  , will have health benefits. ”

The team conducted a computer-based analysis to determine the   54   of a 3-g-per-day reduction in salt intake on rates of heart disease and death. They also calculated the cost savings emerging from the amount of disease that would be  55  because of lower blood pressure. The conclusion: by cutting salt intake nationwide, the U.S. could save $10 billion to $24 billion  56  in health care costs.

**Section B**

**Directions**: _There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on_ **_Answer Sheet 2_** _with a single line through the centre._

**Passage One**

**Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.**

The Gatais used to frown when they received power bills that routinely topped $200. Last September the couple moved into a 1,500-square-foot home in Premier Gardens, a subdivision of 95 “zero-energy homes” (ZEH) just outside town. Now they’re actually eager to see their electricity bills. The grand total over the 10 months they’ve lived in the three-bedroom house: $75. For the past two months they haven’t paid a cent.

ZEH communities are the leading edge of technologies that might someday create houses that produce as much energy as they consume. Premier Gardens is one of a half-dozen subdivisions in California where every home cuts power consumption by 50%, mostly by using low-power appliances and solar panels.

Aside from the panels on the roof, Premier Gardens looks like a community of conventional homes. But inside, special windows cut power bills by blocking solar heat in summer and retaining indoor warmth in winter.

The rest of the energy savings comes from the solar units. They don’t just feed the home they serve. If they generate more power than the home is using, the excess flows into the [[utility]]’s _po__wer grid_ (电网). The residents are billed by “net metering”: they pay for the amount of power they tap off the grid, less the _kilowatts_ (千瓦) they feed into it. If a home generates more power than it uses, the bill is zero.

That sounds like a bad deal for the power company, but it’s not. Solar homes produce the most power on the hot sunny afternoons when everyone rushes home to turn up the air conditioner. “It helps us lower usage at [[peak]] power times,” says solar expert Mike Keesee. “That lets us avoid building costly plants or buying expensive power at [[peak]]usage time.”

What’s not to like? Mostly the costs. The special features can add $25,000 or more to the purchase price of a house. Tax breaks bring the cost down, especially in California, but in many states ZEHs can be prohibitively expensive. For the [[consumer]], it’s a matter of paying now for the hardware to save later on the [[utility|utilities]].

注意：此部分试题请在**答题卡2**上作答。

57. Why are the Gatais eager to see their electricity bills now?

   A) They want to see how much they have saved.

   B) They want to cut down their [[utility]] expenses.

   C) They want to know if they are able to pay.

   D) They want to avoid being overcharged.

58. What is special about the ZEH communities?

   A) They have created cutting-edge technologies.

   B) They aim to be self-sufficient in power supply.

   C) They are subdivided into half a dozen sections.

   D) They are built in harmony with the environment.

59. How are the residents in the ZEH communities billed for electricity use?

A) They are only charged for the amount of power they consume on rainy days.

B) They needn’t pay a single cent for their power consumption on sunny days.

C) They only pay for the excess power that flows into the [[utility]]’s power grid.

D) They pay for the electricity from the grid less their home-generated power.

60. What does the “net metering” practice mean to the power company?

   A) More pressure at [[peak]] time.            C) Increased electricity output.

B) Less profits in the short term.           D) Reduced operational costs.

61. The author believes that buying a house in a ZEH community ____________.

A) is but a dream for average [[consumer|consumers]]

B) gives the owner substantial tax benefits

C) is a worthy investment in the long run

D) contributes to environmental protection

**Passage Two**

**Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.**

     Romantic love has clear evolutionary roots but our views about what makes an ideal romantic relationship can be swayed by the society we live in. So says psychologist Maureen O’Sullivan from the University of San Francisco. She suggests that humans have always tried to strengthen the pair-bond to _maximi__s__e_(使最大化) reproductive success.

     Many societies throughout history and around the world today have cultivated strong pressures to stay married. In those where ties to family and community are strong, lifelong marriages can be [[promote|promoted]] by practices such as the cultural prohibition of divorce and arranged marriages that are seen as a contract between two families, not just two individuals. In modern western societies, however, the focus on individuality and independence means that people are less concerned about _conforming to_ (遵守) the dictates of family and culture. In the absence of societal pressures to maintain pair-bonds, O’Sullivan suggests that romantic love has increasingly come to be seen as the factor that should determine who we stay with and for how long. “That’s why historically we see an increase in romantic love as a basis for forming long-term relationships,” she says.

According to O’Sullivan culture also shapes the sorts of feelings we expect to have, and actually do experience, when in love. Although the negative emotions associated with romantic love—fear of loss, disappointment and jealousy—are fairly consistent across cultures, the positive feelings can vary. “If you ask Japanese students to list the positive attributes they expect in a romantic partner, they rate highly things like loyalty, commitment and devotion,” says O’Sullivan. “If you ask American college women, they expect everything under the sun: in addition to being committed, partners have to be amusing, funny and a friend.”

We judge a potential partner according to our specific cultural expectations about what romantic love should feel like. If you believe that you have found true romance, and your culture tells you that this is what a long-term relationship should be based on, there is less need to rely on social or family pressures to keep couples together, O’Sullivan argues.

The work for which Thomas Malthus is still most widely known is his _Essay on the Principle of Population_, which first appeared in 1798. This book introduced Malthus’s   67   that population inescapably outgrows _subsistence_ (生活资料)，and that this difference   68 population size and the ability to adequately meet the   69   subsistence needs of all of the members of that population “naturally” produces a fundamental struggle for   70  , in which some flourish at the   71   of others.

Charles Darwin’s most important contribution   72   the field of biology, described in his work, _On the Origin of Species_, was to  73   Malthus’s observation that plants and animals multiply faster than nature can provide for them to his own   74   of the process of “evolution”—the notion that different forms of life develop   75   from a common _ancestry_ (祖先). Combining these elements, Darwin   76   that the factors of “the struggle for existence” and “the survival of the fittest” are the central mechanisms   77   which evolution is based. In this sense, then, Darwin introduced the possibility   78   conflict and struggle are biological phenomena, which are   79   central to human social existence.

A number of more contemporary social thinkers were   80   by Darwin and continued this particular version of the conflict perspective, commonly referred to   81   social Darwinism, into the twentieth century. Thus, for example, Herbert Spencer, a   82   English social theorist, applied these ideas of the natural   83   of conflict and survival of the fittest to his notion of social evolution,   84   William Graham Sumner, an American sociologist, saw the   85   for survival among individual actors as operating to bring about fundamental   86   in the quality of human social life overall.

**Part** **II**  **Reading Comprehension (Skimming and Scanning)**

1．【答案】**B)** a combination of causes

【精析】细节题。从题干知道应在第一段找答案。文章第一段探究美国经济衰退的原因，是该责备金融家、监管机构、消费者还是政客？最后一句: All are [[guilty]].说明多方均有责任。所以B)项a combination of causes为正确答案，即各种原因都有。

2．【答案】**A****)** 57%

【精析】细节题。由题干的total value of listed shares定位到第二段中间一句: The value of listed shares in American firms [[collapse|collapsed]] by 57% …, [[collapse|collapsed]]与题干的[[shrink|shrank]]都有缩小的意思，因此答案直接给出：57%。listed shares意为“上市股票”。

3．【答案】**C)** hit his business as hard as the 9/11 terrorist attack

【精析】推理题。题干中的人名Arne Sorenson为关键词，依此可迅速把答案定位到第四段最后一句: This year, without a terrorist attack, the hotel industry is “putting the same numbers on the board” , 即今年虽然没有恐怖袭击，酒店业的收益还是跟911之后一样惨淡。选项C)与原文意思一致，为正确答案。

4．【答案】**D)** they cannot cope with the [[ruinous]] costs [[accumulate|accumulated]] over the post-war years

【精析】细节题。由题干中的The Big Three American carmakers定位到原文第六段，The Big Three American carmakers … [[accumulate|accumulated]] [[ruinous]] costs over the post-war years, …. All three are desperately [[restructuring]]. 即美国三大汽车制造商于战后积累了破坏性的成本，因此需要重组。选项D)与原文意思一致，为正确答案。[[accumulate]]意为“积累”，[[ruinous]]“破坏性的”，restructure“重组”。

5．【答案】**C)** avoid seeming wasteful

【精析】推理题。由题干中的Goldman Sachs定位到第八段最后: Goldman Sachs, …, cancelled a [[conference]] in Las Vegas … and rebooked it in San Francisco, which cost more but sounded less fun.意思是Goldman Sachs银行取消了本来安排在拉斯维加斯的会议，重新安排在旧金山，虽然要花更多的钱，但是（旧金山比拉斯维加斯）听起来没那么奢侈。C)项“避免看起来的浪费”与原文表达一致。

6．【答案】**A)** against too much government interference in the economy 

【精析】推理题。题干虽然没有明显的定位词，由于第五题的答案在第八段得到，根据题文同序规律，第六题的答案可以在第九、十段找。第九段最后: America will [[remain]] the best place on earth to do business, so long as Barack Obama … [[resist]] the [[temptation]] to [[interfere]] too much，作者认为美国依然会是商业天堂，只要奥巴马不要过多干预经济。可见作者是反对政府过多干预经济的，A)项为正确答案。

7．【答案】**D)** by no means be inexpensive

【精析】细节题。由题干中的carbon dioxide [[emission|emissions]]定位到原文倒数第四段首句: Mr. Obama’s plan to [[curb]] carbon dioxide (CO₂) _[[emission|emissions]]_ (排放), though necessary, will be far from cost-free，be far from意为“远不是”，cost-free意为“免费的”，分别与D)项的by no means (绝不是) 和 inexpensive (便宜的) 同义替换，主要表达的是该计划是绝对不省钱的。

8．【答案】**M****an of the** **Y****ear**

【精析】细节题。由题干中的人名Harlow Curtice定位到原文倒数第二段第二句: In 1955 _Time_’s Man of the Year was Harlow Curtice…. His firm was leading America towards “a new economic order”, 直接找到答案: Man of the Year (年度人物)

9．【答案】**poor management**

【精析】细节题。由题干中的chief [[executive]]和fired定位到原文最后一段首句: Half a century later GM is a typical example of poor management. In March its chief [[executive]] was fired by _Time_’s current Man of the Year, Mr Obama.可见被炒的原因是poor management（管理混乱）。

10.【答案】**micromanaging**

【精析】细节题。由题干中的end up定位到原文末段倒数第二句: But there is a danger that Washington will end up micromanaging not only Detroit but also other parts of the economy. 这里Washington指代the Obama administration，micromanage意为“微观管理”。作者担心奥巴马政府最终会过度干预整个美国经济。

**Passage One**

【听力原文】

　　Farmington, Utah, is a more pleasant community since a local girls’4-H club improved Main Street. Six 4-H girls worked to clean a 72 foot curbside that was covered with weeds, rocks and trash. Each member volunteered to clean up and to dig and plot five flats of flowers. They also took turns in watering, weeding and maintaining the plot. Participation in this project helped the girls develop a new attitude towards their parents of their own homes; they’ve learned how to work with tools, and improved their work habits. One mother said that before her daughter was involved in this project, she would not even pull a weed. The experience on Main Street stimulated self-improvement, and encouraged members to take pride in their home grounds and the total community. City officials cooperated with the 4-H members in planting trees, building cooking facilities, picnic tables, swings and public restrooms. The 4-H girls planted trees and took care of them during the early stages of growth. The total park project needed more plantings in the following years. Members of the 4-H Club agreed to follow the project through to completion, because they received satisfaction from the results of constructive work. The project is a growing one and has spread from the park to the school and the shopping center. Trees and flowers have all been planted in the shopping center, making the atmosphere pleasant.

　　According to a survey on reading conducted in 2001 by the U.S. National Education Association (NEA), young Americans say reading is important, more important than computers and science. Over 50% of the twelve to eighteen-year-old interviewed say they enjoy reading a lot. 79% find it stimulating and interesting. And 87% think it is relaxing. About 68% of those surveyed disagree with the opinion that reading is boring or old-fashioned.

Over 66% of teens like to read fiction, such as novels and stories. Over 26% were interested in non-fiction, such as history books. 64% of students listed “reading stories about people my own age” as their favorite topic. Mysteries and detective stories came second on the list at 53%. Just under 50% said they were interested in reading about their own culture and tradition. Of the teenagers who participated in the survey, 49% said that libraries are where they get most of their books. However, many complained that their school libraries do not have enough up-to-date interesting books and magazines. Even though many teenagers in the US enjoy reading, they still have other interests. When asked which activity would be the most difficult to give up for a week, 48% said listening to music. TV would be difficult to give up for 25% of those surveyed.

**Passage Three**

【听力原文】

　　Thank you for coming, everyone. Today’s presentation will show how we see the development of the motor car in the short to medium term, and that is why we have invited all of you here today. Let’s start with power. It’s clear that petrol-driven engines have no future. Already there are many alternative fuel vehicles on the market, powered by anything from solar power to natural gas. Some independent thinkers have even produced cars that run on vegetable oil. But as we all know, of all these alternative fuel vehicles, the most practical are electric vehicles. Sure, in the past electric vehicles have their problems, namely, a limited driving range, and very few recharging points, which limited their use. Now, however, recent developments in electric vehicle technology mean they can match conventional petrol engines in terms of performance and safety. Let’s not forget that electric vehicles are cleaner. Plus, importantly, the power source is rechargeable, so this does not involve using any valuable resources. Moving on to communications. Very soon, cars will be linked to GPS satellites, so they’ll do all the driving for you. What controls [[remain]] for the users will be audio-based. So, for example, you’ll just have to say “a bit warmer”, and the air conditioning will adjust automatically. You’ll also be able to receive email, music and movies, all via an Internet link. So just tap in the destination you want, sit back, sleep, watch your movie, whatever.

33. What is the presentation mainly about?

【重点词汇】 presentation（陈述），medium（中等的）

34. What used to restrict the use of electric vehicles?

【

【重点词汇】 restrict（限制）, range（范围，距离）

35. What does the speaker say about electric vehicles of today?

【重点词汇】 match（比得上，相匹敌），petrol（汽油）

**Section C**

My favorite TV show? “The Twilight Zone.” I (36) **especially** like the episode called “The Printer’s Devil”. It’s about a newspaper editor who’s being (37) **driven** out of business by a big newspaper syndicate – you know, a group of papers (38) **owned** by the same people.

He’s about to (39) **commit** suicide when he is interrupted by an old man who says his name is Smith. The editor is not only offered 5,000 dollars to pay off his newspaper’s (40) **debts**, but this Smith character also offers his (41) **services** for free. It turns out that the guy (42) **operates** the printing machine with amazing speed, and soon he is turning out newspapers with (43) **shocking** headlines. The small paper is successful again. The editor is amazed at how quickly Smith gets his stories – only minutes after they happen – but soon he is presented with a contract to sign. Mr. Smith, it seems, is really the devil! (44) **The editor is frightened by this news, but he is more frightened by the idea of losing his newspaper**, so he agrees to sign. But soon Smith is reporting the news even before it happens – and it’s all terrible – one disaster after another. (45) **Anyway, there is a little more to tell, but I don’t want to ruin the story for you.** I really like these old episodes of “The Twilight Zone”, because the stories are fascinating. (46) **They are not realistic, but then again, in a way they are, because they deal with human nature.**

**Part IV  Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth)**

**Section A**

【文章概述】

这是一篇关于盐分摄入量的科普类文章。研究表明，减少摄入盐分，可以降低心脏病、中风的发病率。

【词性分析】

名  词

A) accidents 事故；I) excess 超额量，多余量；J) impact 影响；K) instances 例子，情况；

动  词

C) avoided避免；D) caused 引起；F) develop 发展；G) documented记录；M) revised修正，修订；O) undertake 承担，从事

形容词

E) considerable 相当大或多的；I) excess过量的，额外的；L) modest谦虚的，适度的；M) revised经过修订的

副  词

B) annually每年；H) dramatically戏剧性地，引人注目地；N) slightly轻微地

双重词性

I) excess n./adj;  M) revised v./adj

47．【答案】L) modest

【精析】空格位于不定冠词a 之后，名词decrease之前，应填入形容词与a 一起修饰名词decrease。原句的意思是“研究表明，即使轻微减少盐分的摄入量都可以对健康带来很大的好处”，因此选L) modest 

48．【答案】**G)** documented

【精析】空格位于主语the authors后面，应填入一个谓语动词。因前文说的是研究，此处承接上文，填入G) documented 记录符合文意。

49．【答案】**K)** instances

【精析】对照前文120,000 cases of heart disease此处应填入一个跟cases类似的名词，表示中风的病例，选K) instances。

50．【答案】**D)** caused

【精析】空格位于by前，应填入一个动词的过去分词表示被动，填入caused“引起”后原句意思为：“作者记录了每天减少摄入三克盐后，每年由高血压引起的疾病如心脏疾患，中风和心脏病发作各下降了120,000；66,000和99,000例”，意思通顺。

51．【答案】**F)** develop

【精析】空格位于be likely to后，应加动词原形，从F) develop和O) undertake中选择。原文意思为“非洲裔美国人比其他种族的人更容易得高血压”，因此选择F) develop。O) undertake一般指承担、从事某项工作。

52．【答案】**I)** excess

【精析】far in excess of远远超过，属固定搭配。此题考到学生不常用的词组，较难。可先从in这一介词着手，后面要跟名词。因此从A) accidents 事故；I) excess 超额量，多余量；J) impact 影响；K) instances 例子，情况 这四个名词中选。填入I) 后为“在美国，人们摄入的盐分含量远远超出了对健康有利的量”，意思通顺。

53．【答案】**N)** slightly

【精析】原文意思是“我们建议全民减少盐分摄入量，尽管      ，都对健康有好处。”填入副词N) slightly“轻微地”意思通顺。

54．【答案】**J)** impact

【精析】空格处位于定冠词the后面，应填入一个名词，且与on形成词组，综合应填入impact表示对…的影响。原文意思为“研究者们进行了一个基于计算机的调查，研究每天减少摄入三克食盐对心脏病发病率和死亡率的影响。”

55．【答案】**C)** avoided

【精析】此句中that引导一个定语从句修饰disease。空格处应填入一个动词的过去分词与be一起形成被动。空格后是because of lower blood pressure，前文讲到高血压引起中风和心脏疾病，因此降低后的血压可以避免疾病，应填入C) avoided。原文意思为“研究者们也计算低血压避免了一些疾病的发生，这样可以节省多少费用。”cost savings意为“节省的费用”。可能会有同学误选E) considerable，以为这样意思为节省的费用是相当多的，但这句讲研究者们做的工作，他们在计算节省的费用有多少，而不是得出结论。

56．【答案】**B)** annually

【精析】此句没有空格也是一个完整的句子，因此应填入副词，可选的有B)和H)。填入B)annually每年后原文意思为“结论：通过全民减少食盐摄入量，美国可以每年节省一百亿到二百四十亿美金医疗费用。”给节省的开支一个时间的限定是必须的，因此选B。

**Section B**

**Passage One**

【文章概述】

本文主题为“零能量家庭（ZEH）”社区。文章首段由Gatais夫妇电费账单的变化引入ZEH社区的话题。第二至三段介绍ZEH社区的概念，并以Premier Gardens社区为例，介绍其省电效果及方法——使用耗电低的电器及在房顶安装太阳能电池板。第四至五段介绍“净电量计费”方法对居民及电厂的影响。末段作者指出虽然ZEH社区房价昂贵，但是长远来看，值得投资。

57．【答案】**A)** They want to see how much they have saved.

【精析】推理题。根据题干关键词人名Gatais以及eager定位到原文第一段第3句和第4句。第3句提到，Gatasis夫妇现在非常急于查看搬至ZEH社区后的电费单，第4句则解释了理由，过去十个月，他们三居室的电费总计为75美元，与第一句提及他们以往电费通常超过200美元形成鲜明对比。因此选项A)他们想查看省了多少电费，符合原文意思。原文中routinely意为“通常地；例行公事地”；选项中[[utility]] expenses意为“公共事业费（如水电、煤气费）”。overcharge意为“索价过高”其中over-为前缀，意为“太多”。

58．【答案】**B****)** They aim to be self-sufficient in power supply.

【精析】细节题。根据题干关键词ZEH communities定位到原文第二段第1句, 意思是ZEH社区是前沿科技（的应用），未来某一天，该科技会创造出可以在能量上自给自足的房子。因此得出选项B)正确，其中self-sufficient in power supply意为电力供应自给自足，与原文produce as much energy as they consume同意，consume意为“消耗”，其名词形式为[[consumer]]，意为“消费者”。考生需注意排除干扰项A），尽管cutting-edge与原文leading edge为同义词，意为“前沿的，尖端的”，但该选项中动词create后的表述与原文不符。原文是创建某种房屋。

59．【答案】**D)** They pay for the electricity from the grid less their home-generated power.

【精析】细节题。由题干关键词residents和billed定位到原文第四段第4句，意为居民通过净电量计费：他们需要支付的电量等于他们利用电网的电量减去他们为电网提供的电量。选项D)与该句构成了同义转述，其中home-generated power对应the kilowatts they feed in to it (此处they指居民，it指电网)，generate产生，tap off 流出，less减(介词)， feed into 注入，流入。

60．【答案】**D)** Reduced operational costs.

【精析】细节题。根据题干中的power company定位到原文第五段，该段首句指出，对电力公司来说，那（即净电量计费）听起来像是糟糕的交易，实则不然。末句进一步说明，该方法使得电力公司不必建造昂贵的发电厂或者在高峰用电时间高价购电。所以答案为D)，降低其经营成本。文中plant 指power plant意为发电厂。

61．【答案】**C)** is a worthy investment in the long run.

【精析】态度题。根据顺序原则及题干中的buying a house（对应原文中的purchase of a house）定位到原文最后一段。该段末句反应了作者的态度，即对消费者而言，它（即在ZEH社区购买房子）意味着现在付钱买硬件，未来节省电费。据此C)正确，即长期来看是一项值得的投资。其中in the long run意为“长远看来”。

【难句分析】

a. ZEH communities are the leading edge of technologies that might someday create houses that produce as much energy as they consume.（第二段第1句）

该句为复合句，主架为ZEH communities are the leading edge of technologies。该句嵌入两个that引导的限制性定语从句，其中that might someday create…修饰technologies, that produce…修饰houses。此外该句中的as…as用于比较句型，译为“和……一样”，在本文中将produce energy和consume energy的数量进行比较。

b. The residents are billed by “net metering”: they pay for the amount of power they tap off the grid, less the kilowatts (千瓦) they feed into it. If a home generates more power than it uses, the bill is zero. （第四段第4句）

该句为复合句，主架为The residents are billed… : they pay for the amount…，其中冒号后面的句子是对前句中net metering的进一步解释。此外后面一句中they tap off the grid为省略that的限制性定语从句，修饰power；介词短语less the kilowatts…在该句中作状语，并且又嵌入一个省略that的限制性定语从句they feed into it,修饰kilowatts。

**Passage Two**

**【**文章概述**】**

      本文是关于爱情、社会规约与婚姻的一篇文章。历史上，很多社会把包办婚姻看作两个家庭之间的协定，婚姻不只是个人之间的事情；有些社会文化上禁止离婚，这种文化促进了长久的婚姻。在现代西方社会，人们强调个性和独立，少了社会的压力，长久的婚姻越来越依靠浪漫的爱情。不同文化的人对爱情的期待也有所不同，如日本人把忠诚摆在首位，而美国人除了要求忠诚，还期待另一半有幽默感。

62．【答案】**A)** They vary from culture to culture.

【精析】从people’s views of an ideal romantic relationship回溯至文章第一段第一句话，浪漫的爱情有很清晰的进化根基，但我们对构成完美关系的元素的看法受到社会的影响。sway意为影响。因此选A，关于什么造就了完美的两性关系，在各个文化中的人们是有不同观点的。

63．【答案】**B)** can contribute to stable marriages

【精析】从strong family and community ties定位至第二段第2句。In those where ties to family and community are strong, lifelong marriages can be [[promote|promoted]] by practices…。[[promote]]“促进”与contribute to 同义，lifelong marriages和B选项的stable marriages也一致。因此选B。

64．【答案】**B)** plays a key role in maintaining long-term relationships

【精析】从Without social pressures回溯至文章第二段倒数第二句In the absence of societal pressures to maintain pair-bonds, O’Sullivan suggests that romantic love has increasingly come to be seen as the factor that should determine who we stay with and for how long. O’Sullivan说，在没有社会压力来维持两性关系时，浪漫的爱情越来越被看成决定我们跟谁在一起，在一起多久的因素。因此选B。

65．【答案】**A)** they expect different things from their partner

    【精析】从题干when people from different cultures fall in love定位至第三段第一句culture also shapes the sorts of feelings we expect to have。虽然浪漫爱情中的负面情感如害怕失去、失望、嫉妒等在不同文化中是一致的，但正面情感可能有所不同。如日本人把忠诚摆在首位，而美国人除了要求忠诚，还期待另一半有幽默感。因此来自不同文化的人相爱，期待的东西不一样。

66．【答案】**C)** romantic love is becoming increasingly important in family relationships

【精析】全文主要比较了家庭和社会的规约跟浪漫的爱情在维持两性关系上的作用。从第三段后半部分知道，在当代西方社会，人们强调个性和独立，更少在意家庭和社会的规约了，浪漫的爱情能维持两性关系的长久。此外文章最后一句也再次强调了true romance 在keep couples together上的作用比来自于社会和家庭的压力更大。因此选C。A选项不符文意，B，D均过于片面。

【难句分析】

c. In those where ties to family and community are strong, lifelong marriages can be [[promote|promoted]] by practices such as the cultural prohibition of divorce and arranged marriages that are seen as a contract between tow families, not just two individuals. (第二段第2句)

     lifelong 终生的, [[promote]]促进, prohibition禁止, arranged marriages包办婚姻。主干是marriages can be [[promote|promoted]] by practices。Where引导一个定语从句，修饰those指代的many societies。such as… and…具体举例说明practices。“that are seen…”为定语从句修饰“arranged marriages”整句的意思为“在那些家庭关系和社区联系很紧密的社会中，习俗和惯例促成了长久的婚姻。例如文化上对离婚的禁止和包办婚姻。其中后者被看作两个家庭间的协议而不只是两个人之间的事情。”
